# ADR-0007: Provenance Traceability Architecture

**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Scope**: Data lineage and audit trail

---

## Context

Users need to trace data lineage from canonical transaction back to original source:

```
Canonical Transaction ‚Üí Observation ‚Üí Upload Event ‚Üí Original PDF Artifact
```

**Key requirements:**

1. **Auditability**: Full trace for regulatory compliance (SOX, GDPR)
2. **Debugging**: Developers can verify normalization decisions
3. **Trust**: Users can inspect original source for disputed transactions
4. **Security**: Artifact access must be controlled and time-limited

**The problem:**
- Canonical transactions are normalized/deduplicated
- Users see "Amount: $50.00, Merchant: Amazon" but need to verify:
  - Which PDF page showed this?
  - Was amount rounded/normalized?
  - What exact text did parser extract?

---

## Decision

**We implement full provenance trace with signed URLs for artifact access.**

Architecture:
1. **ProvenanceTracer** traverses: `canonical_id ‚Üí observation_id ‚Üí upload_id ‚Üí artifact_ref`
2. **ArtifactRetriever** generates signed URLs (S3 presigned, 1h expiry)
3. **DrillDownPanel** displays complete lineage with clickable artifact links

---

## Rationale

### 1. Regulatory Compliance
- SOX requires audit trail for financial data
- GDPR requires data lineage for user privacy
- Full trace proves data transformations are correct

### 2. Debugging Capabilities
- Developers can inspect original PDF when parser fails
- Compare normalized vs raw observation data
- Identify systematic parser errors

### 3. User Trust
- Users verify "Amazon" normalization came from "AMZN MKTPLACE"
- Inspect original receipt for disputed charges
- Understand why duplicate transactions were merged

### 4. Security
- Signed URLs prevent unauthorized artifact access
- Time-limited (1h) prevents long-term URL sharing
- Audit log tracks who accessed which artifacts

---

## Consequences

### ‚úÖ Positive

- **Full audit trail**: Complete lineage for compliance
- **Enhanced debugging**: Developers trace issues to source
- **User trust**: Transparent normalization decisions
- **Secure access**: Signed URLs with expiration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs

- **More storage**: Provenance entries ~100 bytes per transaction
- **More latency**: 3 queries for full trace (canonical ‚Üí observation ‚Üí upload ‚Üí artifact)
- **Index overhead**: Requires indexes on observation_id, upload_id
- **Complexity**: ProvenanceTracer logic adds code complexity

### üî¥ Risks (Mitigated)

- **Risk**: Artifact storage costs grow unbounded
  - **Mitigation**: S3 lifecycle policy archives artifacts >1 year to Glacier
  - Cost: $0.004/GB/month (S3) ‚Üí $0.001/GB/month (Glacier)

- **Risk**: Signed URL expiration breaks saved links
  - **Mitigation**: UI refreshes signed URL on every click
  - Backend regenerates URL with new 1h expiration

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative A: Observation-Only Trace (Rejected)

**Pros:**
- Simpler: Only track `canonical_id ‚Üí observation_id`
- No artifact retrieval needed

**Cons:**
- **No original source**: Cannot verify parser correctness
- **Debugging limited**: Cannot inspect PDF when parser fails
- **Trust issues**: Users cannot verify normalization decisions

### Alternative B: Embed Artifacts in Database (Rejected)

**Pros:**
- No signed URLs needed
- Faster retrieval (no S3 round-trip)

**Cons:**
- **Database bloat**: PDFs are large (1-10MB each)
- **Duplicate storage**: Multiple observations ‚Üí multiple PDF copies
- **Expensive**: Database storage ~10x more expensive than S3

### Alternative C: No Provenance Trace (Rejected)

**Pros:**
- Simplest implementation
- Zero storage overhead
- Fastest queries

**Cons:**
- **No compliance**: Fails SOX/GDPR requirements
- **No debugging**: Cannot trace parser errors
- **No trust**: Users cannot verify data transformations

## Implementation Notes

### Provenance Chain Structure

```
CanonicalTransaction
  ‚îú‚îÄ canonical_id: "TX_abc123"
  ‚îî‚îÄ observation_ids: ["OBS_001", "OBS_002"]  ‚Üê Multiple observations merged

Observation
  ‚îú‚îÄ observation_id: "OBS_001"
  ‚îú‚îÄ upload_id: "UL_xyz789"
  ‚îî‚îÄ raw_data: { amount: "$50.00", merchant: "AMZN MKTPLACE" }

UploadRecord
  ‚îú‚îÄ upload_id: "UL_xyz789"
  ‚îî‚îÄ artifact_ref: "s3://bucket/uploads/xyz789.pdf"

Artifact (S3)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Signed URL: "https://s3.../xyz789.pdf?signature=..."
```

### Query Flow

```sql
-- 1. Get observation IDs from canonical transaction
SELECT observation_ids FROM canonical_transactions
WHERE canonical_id = 'TX_abc123';

-- 2. Get upload ID from observation
SELECT upload_id FROM observations
WHERE observation_id = 'OBS_001';

-- 3. Get artifact reference from upload
SELECT artifact_ref FROM uploads
WHERE upload_id = 'UL_xyz789';

-- 4. Generate signed URL (application logic)
signed_url = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(artifact_ref, expires_in=3600)
```

### Required Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_canonical_observations
ON canonical_transactions USING GIN (observation_ids);

CREATE INDEX idx_observation_upload
ON observations (upload_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_upload_artifact
ON uploads (artifact_ref);
```

---

## Related Decisions

- **ADR-0001**: Uses `upload_id` as stable identifier in provenance chain
- **ADR-0002**: State machine tracks upload lifecycle for provenance
- **Future**: May add blockchain-anchored hashes for immutable audit trail
