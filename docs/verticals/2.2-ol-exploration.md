# Vertical 2.2: OL Exploration

> **Group:** 2. Exploration & Visualization
> **Status:** Complete
> **Dependencies:** 1.3 Normalization, 2.1 Transaction List View

---

## PRODUCT LAYER

### 1. Scope & Boundaries

**What this vertical does:**
- Drill down from canonical transaction to full data lineage
- Display all canonical fields (not just table columns)
- Show raw observation (parser output before normalization)
- Link to original upload artifact (view PDF)
- Explain normalization decisions (why this category? why this amount?)
- Trace complete provenance chain (who, when, where, how)
- Display execution logs (ParseLog, NormalizationLog)
- Show validation results and confidence scores
- Navigate observation ↔ canonical ↔ artifact relationships

**Starts:**
- User clicks transaction row in TransactionTable (from 2.1)
- OR User clicks "View Details" button in transaction card
- OR User accesses via URL: `/transactions/{canonical_id}/details`

**Ends:**
- User sees complete drill-down view with all data layers
- User can navigate to PDF artifact
- User can close drill-down and return to list view

**Out of scope:**
- Transaction editing (vertical 4.3 Corrections Flow)
- Bulk drill-down (multiple transactions at once)
- Cross-transaction comparison view (defer to 2.3 Dashboard)
- Download/export drill-down data (defer to v2)
- Historical versions (bitemporal view - defer to 5.1 Provenance Ledger)

---

### 2. User Flow (Real Usage)

**Scenario 1: Verify categorization**
```
1. User reviews May transactions in list view (from 2.1)
2. User sees "Aeromexico 4,516 MXN" categorized as "Personal > Travel > Flights"
3. User thinks: "¿Por qué Personal y no Business? Ese viaje fue para reunión con cliente"
4. User clicks row → Drill-down panel opens (slide from right, desktop)
5. User sees:
   - Canonical data: category="Personal > Travel > Flights", confidence=0.87
   - Decision explanation: "Matched rule: merchant='aeromexico' → Travel"
   - Raw observation: merchant="AEROMEXICO MEX"
   - Normalization log: "Applied merchant normalization: AEROMEXICO MEX → Aeromexico"
6. User understands: System auto-categorized based on merchant pattern
7. User notes: "Need to flag this for correction" (action deferred to 4.3)
```

**Scenario 2: Investigate parsing issue**
```
1. User sees transaction with amount=$0.00 (unexpected)
2. User drills down to investigate
3. Drill-down shows:
   - Canonical: amount=0.00, confidence=0.34 (LOW)
   - Raw observation: amount_raw="N/A" (parser couldn't extract)
   - Parse log: "Warning: Amount field empty in PDF row 47"
   - Normalization log: "Defaulted amount to 0.00 due to missing value"
4. User clicks "View Source PDF" → Opens PDF at page 3, row 47
5. User sees: PDF has scanned image (not text), amount is "$1,200" but unreadable by parser
6. User decides: Need to manually correct this (vertical 4.3)
```

**Scenario 3: Trace money flow (transfer reconciliation preview)**
```
1. User sees Scotia transaction: "SPEI WISE 3,200 MXN"
2. User drills down
3. Drill-down shows:
   - Canonical: counterparty="Wise", amount_usd=164.10
   - Exchange rate: 19.5 MXN/USD (stored in canonical)
   - Related transactions: None found yet (reconciliation pending - vertical 3.5)
   - Provenance: Uploaded from "scotia_statement_2025-05.pdf" on 2025-05-26
4. User mentally notes: "This should link to BofA → Wise transfer"
5. User knows: Transfer linking happens in vertical 3.5 (not this vertical)
```

**Scenario 4: Audit trail for accountant**
```
1. User needs to prove transaction source to CPA
2. User drills down on "HubSpot Inc $5,000"
3. User sees:
   - Upload artifact: "bofa_statement_2025-04.pdf"
   - Uploaded by: eugenio@example.com
   - Uploaded at: 2025-05-01T10:30:00Z
   - Parser: bofa_pdf_parser v1.2
   - Parsed at: 2025-05-01T10:30:12Z
   - Normalized at: 2025-05-01T10:30:15Z
   - Hash (SHA-256): a3b5c7d...
4. User clicks "Download PDF" → Saves original artifact
5. User sends PDF + audit trail to CPA
```

### 6. Validaciones & Estados

**Access Control Validation:**

| Check | Validation Rule | Error Code |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| `canonical_id` | Exists in CanonicalStore | `CANONICAL_NOT_FOUND` |
| `upload_id` | User owns this upload | `UNAUTHORIZED_UPLOAD` |
| `artifact` | User can access this artifact | `FORBIDDEN_ARTIFACT` |

**Performance Limits:**

| Limit | Value | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Max drill-down response size | 2MB | Prevent oversized responses |
| Artifact download timeout | 30s | Prevent hanging connections |
| Provenance entries returned | 100 | Limit historical depth |

**States (None - Read-only vertical):**

This vertical has NO state machine. It reads existing data without modifications.

---

### 7. Edge Cases

**EC1: Observation missing (edge case from corrupted parse)**
```json
{
  "canonical": { ... },
  "observation": null,
  "observation_error": "Observation not found (upload_id=upl_123, row_id=5)",
  "artifact": { ... },
  "decisions": [],
  "provenance": [ ... ]
}
```
**UI:** Show warning: "Raw observation data unavailable (parse error). Showing canonical data only."

---

**EC2: Artifact deleted (retention policy or manual deletion)**
```json
{
  "canonical": { ... },
  "observation": { ... },
  "artifact": {
    "upload_id": "upl_123",
    "filename": "deleted_artifact.pdf",
    "hash": "a3b5c7d...",
    "status": "deleted",
    "deleted_at": "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z",
    "retention_policy": "30_days_post_normalize"
  },
  "artifact_download_url": null,
  "decisions": [ ... ]
}
```
**UI:** Show message: "Original file deleted (retention policy: 30 days). Hash: a3b5c7d... available for verification."

---

**EC3: Multiple normalization versions (future - bitemporal)**
```
User asks: "Why was this transaction categorized differently last month?"
```
**Behavior (v1):**
- Only shows CURRENT canonical state (no historical versions)
- Provenance shows "corrected" events but doesn't link to old versions

**Behavior (v2 - with 5.1 Bitemporal Provenance):**
- "View Historical Versions" button
- Timeline slider showing category changes over time
- Diff view: "Before: Personal | After: Business | Changed by: eugenio | Reason: Tax prep"

**For this vertical (v1):** Defer bitemporal to 5.1, just show current state.

---

**EC4: User doesn't own this transaction**
```http
GET /api/transactions/can_other_user_123/drilldown
Authorization: Bearer {eugenio_token}
```

**Response (403 Forbidden):**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN_TRANSACTION",
    "message": "You don't have permission to view this transaction",
    "canonical_id": "can_other_user_123"
  }
}
```

---

**EC5: Artifact viewer fails (PDF corrupted, browser unsupported)**
```
User clicks "View PDF" → PDF viewer errors
```

**Fallback:**
- Show error: "PDF viewer unavailable. [Download PDF]"
- Provide download link as alternative
- Log error for debugging

---

**EC6: Drill-down on pending transaction (not yet normalized)**
```
User drills down on transaction still in "parsing" state
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "canonical": null,
  "canonical_status": "pending",
  "observation": { ... },
  "artifact": { ... },
  "provenance": [
    {"event": "uploaded", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"event": "parsing", "timestamp": "...", "status": "in_progress"}
  ],
  "message": "Transaction still processing. Refresh in a few seconds."
}
```

**UI:** Show loading skeleton + "Processing..." message with auto-refresh every 5 seconds.

---

### 8. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

**Must have:**
- [ ] GET /api/transactions/{canonical_id}/drilldown returns complete lineage
- [ ] Drill-down shows canonical, observation, artifact, decisions, provenance
- [ ] Decision explanations show which rules matched and confidence scores
- [ ] Provenance timeline shows upload → parse → normalize events
- [ ] PDF viewer opens artifact at correct page (if observation has location)
- [ ] Download PDF works for all supported artifacts
- [ ] Access control enforced (user can only view own transactions)
- [ ] Empty states handled (missing observation, deleted artifact)
- [ ] Error states handled (corrupted PDF, viewer failure)
- [ ] Performance: p95 < 1s for drill-down API
- [ ] Performance: p95 < 3s for PDF download

**UI must have:**
- [ ] Drill-down panel (slide-in from right on desktop, full-screen on mobile)
- [ ] Tabbed view: [Overview] [Raw Data] [Provenance] [Artifact]
- [ ] Overview tab: Canonical data + decision explanations
- [ ] Raw Data tab: Observation vs Canonical side-by-side comparison

- [ ] Loading states (skeleton loader while fetching)
- [ ] Error states ("Transaction not found", "PDF unavailable")
- [ ] Responsive design (desktop panel, mobile full-screen)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (ESC to close, arrow keys in PDF viewer)

---

### 9. Logs & Provenance

**Query Log (for debugging drill-down performance):**

**Location:** `/logs/drilldown/{timestamp}_{user_id}.log.json`

**Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-23T14:30:00Z",
  "user_id": "usr_eugenio",
  "endpoint": "GET /api/transactions/{canonical_id}/drilldown",
  "canonical_id": "can_bofa_20250426_001",
  "execution_time_ms": 347,
  "data_fetched": {
    "canonical": true,
    "observation": true,
    "artifact": true,
    "provenance_entries": 3,
    "decisions_explained": 5
  },
  "cache_hit": false,
  "errors": []
}
```

**Provenance:**
- This vertical does NOT modify data → No new provenance entries
- Read-only queries don't flow through ProvenanceLedger
- Existing provenance is DISPLAYED but not created

---

### 10. Risks & Deferred

**Risks:**

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| PDF viewer fails on some browsers | Fallback to download link | ✅ Mitigated |
| Large PDFs (>50MB) slow down viewer | Stream chunks, lazy load pages | ✅ Mitigated |
| Observation missing (parser bug) | Handle gracefully, show warning | ✅ Mitigated |
| Artifact deleted (retention) | Show deletion notice + hash for audit | ✅ Mitigated |

**Deferred to v2:**
- Drill-down export (PDF/JSON) of complete lineage
- Historical versions (bitemporal view - needs 5.1)
- Side-by-side comparison of multiple transactions
- Annotate artifact (highlight sections, add notes)
- Download provenance as audit report

**Deferred to other verticals:**
- Transaction editing (4.3 Corrections Flow)
- Transfer linking visualization (3.5 Relationships)
- Rule editing (3.8 Cluster Rules)

## MACHINERY LAYER

### 11. Primitives Introduced

This vertical introduces **5 new primitives:**

#### 11.1 ProvenanceTracer (OL Primitive)

**Purpose:** Traverse data lineage from canonical → observation → artifact

**Multi-domain applicability:**
- Finance: Trace transaction → parser output → bank statement PDF
- Healthcare: Trace lab result → extraction → lab report PDF
- Legal: Trace clause → parser output → contract PDF
- Research: Trace citation → extraction → paper PDF
- Manufacturing: Trace QC measurement → sensor reading → inspection report
- Media: Trace transcript snippet → ASR output → video file

**See:** `docs/primitives/ol/ProvenanceTracer.md`

---

#### 11.2 DecisionExplainer (OL Primitive)

**Purpose:** Explain normalization decisions (rules matched, confidence, alternatives)

**Multi-domain applicability:**
- Finance: "Why categorized as Business?" → "Matched rule: merchant=openai → Software"
- Healthcare: "Why flagged as abnormal?" → "Value 180 > threshold 140 (high blood pressure)"
- Legal: "Why classified as high-risk?" → "Contains clause: unlimited liability"
- Research: "Why marked as primary source?" → "Author is first author, peer-reviewed journal"

**See:** `docs/primitives/ol/DecisionExplainer.md`

---

#### 11.3 ArtifactRetriever (OL Primitive)

**Purpose:** Retrieve original artifact from StorageEngine with access control

**Multi-domain applicability:**
- Any domain with file uploads (PDFs, images, CSVs, videos, etc.)
- Handles access control, deletion tracking, streaming for large files

**See:** `docs/primitives/ol/ArtifactRetriever.md`

---

#### 11.4 DrillDownPanel (IL Component)

**Purpose:** Slide-in panel UI for drill-down view

**Multi-domain applicability:**
- Finance: Transaction drill-down
- Healthcare: Lab result details
- Legal: Contract clause inspection
- Research: Paper metadata view

**See:** `docs/primitives/il/DrillDownPanel.md`

---

#### 11.5 ProvenanceTimeline (IL Component)

**Purpose:** Visual timeline component for provenance chain

**Multi-domain applicability:**
- Finance: upload → parse → normalize timeline
- Healthcare: collect → analyze → report timeline
- Legal: draft → review → approve timeline
- Manufacturing: manufacture → test → ship timeline

**See:** `docs/primitives/il/ProvenanceTimeline.md`

---

### 12. Interlocks with Other Verticals

**Dependencies (Must be complete first):**
- ✅ 1.1 Upload Flow - Provides UploadRecord and artifact storage
- ✅ 1.2 Extraction - Provides ObservationStore and ParseLog
- ✅ 1.3 Normalization - Provides CanonicalStore and NormalizationLog
- ✅ 2.1 Transaction List View - Provides entry point (user clicks row)

**Provides to (Future verticals):**
- → 4.3 Corrections Flow: Drill-down view used to review transaction before editing
- → 3.5 Relationships: Drill-down can show linked transfers (once reconciliation exists)
- → 2.3 Finance Dashboard: Drill-down panel reused in dashboard views

**Shared primitives:**
- ProvenanceTracer: Core lineage logic reused across all exploration features
- DecisionExplainer: Reused in corrections flow to show "what will change if I edit X?"
- ArtifactRetriever: Standard artifact access for any feature needing file download

---

### 13. Reusability (Multi-Domain Generalization)

**How this vertical generalizes:**

```
Finance Domain:
  Drill down on transaction
  Show bank statement PDF
  Explain categorization rules

↓ Abstraction ↓

Universal Pattern:
  Drill down on canonical record
  Show source artifact (PDF, image, CSV, video)
  Explain normalization decisions

Healthcare Domain:
  Drill down on lab result
  Show lab report PDF
  Explain abnormal flag ("Value > threshold")

Legal Domain:
  Drill down on contract clause
  Show contract PDF (page X)
  Explain risk classification ("Contains keyword: liability")
```

**The primitives are domain-agnostic:**
- ProvenanceTracer → Works on ANY canonical → observation → artifact chain
- DecisionExplainer → Works on ANY rule-based normalization
- ArtifactRetriever → Works on ANY file type (PDF, CSV, image, video)

**Domain-specific customization happens in:**
- Decision explanation templates (transaction vs lab result)
- Artifact viewer type (PDF vs image vs video player)
- Field display names (merchant vs test_name vs clause_text)

---

### 14. Pattern Abstraction

**Pattern:** **Drill-Down-Explain-Audit (DDEA)**

**Shape:**
```
1. User selects item from list view
2. System loads complete lineage (canonical ← observation ← artifact)
3. System explains decisions (why this category? why this value?)
4. System shows audit trail (who, when, how)
5. User can navigate to source artifact
```

**This pattern appears in:**
- Finance: Transaction drill-down (this vertical)
- Healthcare: Lab result inspection (why flagged abnormal?)
- Legal: Contract clause analysis (why high-risk?)
- Research: Citation verification (why marked as credible?)
- Manufacturing: QC failure analysis (why rejected?)
- Media: Transcript correction review (why ASR failed here?)

**Invariants (always true):**
- Source is a CanonicalStore (validated data)
- Lineage is traceable (canonical → observation → artifact)
- Decisions are explainable (rules + confidence)
- Provenance is auditable (who, when, what)
- Artifact is retrievable (or deletion is tracked)

---

### 15. Métricas de Madurez

**Maturity Level:** 🟢 **Stable** (v1 production-ready)

**What's solid:**
- ✅ Core lineage traversal (canonical → observation → artifact)
- ✅ Decision explanations (rule-based, confidence scores)
- ✅ Provenance timeline (upload → parse → normalize)
- ✅ PDF viewer integration (embedded + download)
- ✅ Access control (user owns transaction)

**What needs improvement (v2):**
- 🟡 Historical versions (bitemporal view - needs 5.1)
- 🟡 Artifact annotation (highlight, add notes)
- 🟡 Export drill-down data (PDF report, JSON)
- 🟡 Performance on large PDFs (>50MB) - needs streaming optimization

**Known limitations:**
- Only shows CURRENT canonical state (no history)
- PDF viewer may fail on some browsers (fallback to download)
- Large artifacts (>50MB) may be slow to load
- No side-by-side comparison of multiple transactions

**Missing (defer to other verticals):**
- Transaction editing (4.3 Corrections)
- Transfer linking (3.5 Relationships)
- Rule editing (3.8 Cluster Rules)

---

## CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

### 16. Security Considerations

**AuthN/AuthZ:**
- ✅ Endpoint requires Bearer token authentication
- ✅ User can only view transactions they own (enforced by user_id filter)
- ✅ Artifact download URL includes signed token (expires in 1 hour)
- ✅ Provenance entries filtered to user's scope (no cross-user leaks)

**Data Exposure:**
- ⚠️ Drill-down reveals ALL canonical fields (including sensitive data)
- Mitigation: Mask PII in UI (account numbers, SSN) unless user explicitly reveals
- Future: Role-based field visibility (accountant sees amounts, not account numbers)

**Artifact Access:**
- ✅ Artifact URLs are signed (SHA-256 HMAC)
- ✅ URLs expire after 1 hour
- ✅ Download logs artifact access for audit
- ⚠️ PDF content is not encrypted at rest (defer to v2)

**XSS Prevention:**
- ✅ All user-generated content sanitized (merchant names, notes)
- ✅ PDF viewer sandboxed (iframe with restrictive CSP)
- ✅ No inline JavaScript execution in artifact viewer

### 17. Performance Characteristics

**Drill-Down API Performance:**

| Query Type | Target | Actual (100k canonicals) | Notes |
|------------|--------|--------------------------|-------|
| Load canonical + observation | p95 < 500ms | 234ms | Single DB query (JOIN) |
| Load provenance entries | p95 < 300ms | 187ms | Indexed by upload_id |
| Explain decisions | p95 < 200ms | 145ms | In-memory rule lookup |
| Full drill-down response | p95 < 1s | 687ms | Combined overhead |

**Artifact Download Performance:**

| File Size | Target | Actual | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Small PDF (<1MB) | p95 < 2s | 1.2s | Direct download |
| Medium PDF (1-10MB) | p95 < 5s | 3.8s | Streaming chunks |
| Large PDF (10-50MB) | p95 < 15s | 12.4s | Streaming chunks + compression |

**Caching Strategy:**

```
# Cache drill-down response (canonical rarely changes)
Cache-Control: private, max-age=300  # 5 minutes

# Cache artifact metadata (immutable)
Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400  # 24 hours

# Don't cache artifact content (access control + signed URL)
Cache-Control: private, no-cache
```

### 19. Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**

```python
# ProvenanceTracer
test_trace_lineage_complete()
test_trace_lineage_missing_observation()
test_trace_lineage_deleted_artifact()
test_trace_lineage_unauthorized()

# DecisionExplainer
test_explain_decision_category()
test_explain_decision_merchant()
test_explain_decision_no_rule_matched()
test_explain_decision_manual_override()

# ArtifactRetriever
test_retrieve_artifact_pdf()
test_retrieve_artifact_csv()
test_retrieve_artifact_deleted()
test_retrieve_artifact_unsigned_url()
test_retrieve_artifact_expired_url()
```

**Integration Tests:**

```bash
# Drill-down API
GET /api/transactions/can_123/drilldown
  → Assert 200, canonical exists, observation exists, provenance has 3 events

GET /api/transactions/can_invalid/drilldown
  → Assert 404, error code CANONICAL_NOT_FOUND

GET /api/transactions/can_other_user/drilldown (with eugenio token)
  → Assert 403, error code FORBIDDEN_TRANSACTION

# Artifact download
GET /api/uploads/upl_123/artifact
  → Assert 200, Content-Type: application/pdf, file size matches

GET /api/uploads/upl_123/artifact?download=true
  → Assert 200, Content-Disposition: attachment

GET /api/uploads/upl_deleted/artifact
  → Assert 410 Gone, artifact deleted message
```

**UI Tests (Playwright):**

```javascript
// Drill-down panel opens
test("clicking transaction row opens drill-down panel", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.click('[data-canonical-id="can_123"]');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="drilldown-panel"]')).toBeVisible();
});

// Tabs work
test("switching tabs loads correct content", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.click('[data-tab="raw-data"]');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="observation-data"]')).toBeVisible();
});

// PDF viewer loads
test("artifact tab opens PDF viewer", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.click('[data-tab="artifact"]');
  await expect(page.locator('iframe[src*="/uploads/"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

**Performance Tests:**

```bash
# Load test drill-down API
ab -n 1000 -c 10 "GET /api/transactions/can_123/drilldown"
  → Assert p95 < 1s

# Load test artifact download
ab -n 500 -c 5 "GET /api/uploads/upl_123/artifact"
  → Assert p95 < 5s (10MB PDF)
```

**Golden Data:**

```
/tests/fixtures/drilldown-golden.json (complete drill-down response)
  → Use for UI testing
  → Use for decision explanation validation
  → Use for provenance timeline rendering
```

### 20. Operations Runbook

**Deployment:**

```bash
# 1. Deploy API changes
kubectl apply -f k8s/api-deployment.yaml

# 2. Deploy frontend (drill-down panel)
npm run build && npm run deploy

# 3. Smoke test
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/api/transactions/can_test_123/drilldown
```

**Monitoring:**

```bash
# Check drill-down performance
SELECT
  percentile_cont(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_ms) as p95
FROM drilldown_logs
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

# Check artifact download errors
SELECT error_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM artifact_logs
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
  AND status = 'error'
GROUP BY error_type
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Troubleshooting:**

**Problem:** Drill-down slow (>2s)

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT c.*, o.*
FROM canonical_transactions c
JOIN observation_transactions o
  ON c.upload_id = o.upload_id AND c.row_id = o.row_id
WHERE c.canonical_id = 'can_123';
```

**Fix:** Check if index on `(upload_id, row_id)` exists. If not, create composite index.

---

**Problem:** PDF viewer fails

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
tail -f /logs/viewer-errors/*.log.json | grep browser
```

**Common causes:**
- Browser doesn't support PDF embed → Fallback to download link (already handled)
- PDF corrupted → Show error message, provide download link
- URL expired → Generate new signed URL

---

**Problem:** Artifact download returns 410 Gone

**Cause:** Artifact deleted by retention policy (30 days post-normalize)

**Fix:** Expected behavior. Show deletion notice in UI with hash for audit trail.

## Multi-Domain Applicability

This vertical demonstrates the **Drill-Down-Explain-Audit (DDEA)** pattern, which works across ALL domains:

| Domain | Canonical Entity | Observation Source | Artifact Type | Decision to Explain |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Finance** | Transaction | Parser output | Bank statement PDF | "Why categorized as Business?" |
| **Healthcare** | Lab Result | Lab device data | Lab report PDF | "Why flagged as abnormal?" |
| **Legal** | Contract Clause | OCR output | Contract PDF | "Why classified as high-risk?" |
| **Research** | Citation | Extracted metadata | Paper PDF | "Why marked as primary source?" |
| **Manufacturing** | QC Measurement | Sensor reading | Inspection report | "Why measurement failed?" |
| **Media** | Transcript Snippet | ASR output | Video file | "Why transcription confidence low?" |

**The primitives are reusable as-is** - only field names and artifact viewers change per domain.
