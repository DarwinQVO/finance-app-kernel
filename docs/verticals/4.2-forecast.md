# Vertical 4.2: Forecast (Income/Expense Projections & Cash Runway Analysis)

> **Type:** Predictive Analytics System
> **Pattern:** Time Series Forecasting + Goal Tracking + Burn Rate Analysis
> **Last Updated:** 2025-10-24

---

## 📋 Overview

The **Forecast** vertical provides an **intelligent projection system** for future income/expense trends, cash runway calculation, goal tracking, and burn rate analysis. While demonstrated in the finance domain (cash flow projections, savings goals), the underlying primitives are domain-agnostic and apply to ANY forecasting system across domains.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters) with linear regression fallback for trend/seasonality detection
- **Cash Runway Calculation:** Predict months until account balance reaches $0 based on current burn rate
- **Goal Tracking:** Set financial targets (monthly income, savings goals) with progress monitoring and deadline alerts
- **Burn Rate Analysis:** Detect spending trends, acceleration, and budget variance
- **Confidence Intervals:** Probabilistic projections with 80%, 90%, 95% confidence bands
- **Multi-Horizon Forecasts:** Short-term (1-3 months), medium-term (6 months), long-term (12+ months)
- **Scenario Planning:** Best case, worst case, expected case projections
- **Hybrid Caching:** Pre-calculated projections with 24h TTL, real-time recalculation on new transactions

**Finance Domain Examples:**
- **Income Projection:** "Based on last 6 months, expected income for Nov 2024: $5,200 ± $400 (90% confidence)"
- **Expense Forecast:** "Projected expenses for Q4 2024: $12,500 (dining: $1,800, rent: $3,000, utilities: $600)"
- **Cash Runway:** "At current burn rate ($2,100/month), savings account will reach $0 in 8.3 months (June 2025)"
- **Savings Goal:** "Goal: $10,000 by Dec 31, 2024. Current: $7,200 (72%). On track to reach $9,800 (shortfall: $200)"
- **Burn Rate Alert:** "Spending increased 18% last month ($2,480 vs $2,100 avg). Runway decreased from 9.5 months to 8.3 months."

**Multi-Domain Applicability:**
- **Healthcare:** Patient volume forecasting, equipment budget planning, insurance cost projections, bed occupancy predictions, staff scheduling optimization
- **Legal:** Case volume projections, billable hours goals, retainer runway analysis, litigation cost forecasting, settlement probability modeling
- **Research:** Grant funding runway, publication rate goals, equipment replacement forecasting, research output projections, citation growth modeling
- **E-commerce:** Revenue projections, inventory forecasting, customer acquisition cost trends, churn rate predictions, GMV growth modeling
- **SaaS:** MRR projections, churn rate forecasting, CAC payback period, ARR growth modeling, user growth predictions
- **Logistics:** Shipment volume forecasting, fuel cost projections, warehouse capacity planning, delivery time predictions, fleet utilization optimization

## Product Layer (Sections 1-10)

### 1. Scope & Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Time series forecasting using exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters triple exponential with seasonality)
- Linear regression fallback for simpler trends (when insufficient data for Holt-Winters)
- Moving average baseline (3-month, 6-month, 12-month) for quick estimates
- Cash runway calculation (months until balance reaches $0 at current burn rate)
- Goal tracking CRUD (create savings goals, income targets, spending limits)
- Goal progress monitoring (percentage complete, days remaining, on-track status)
- Burn rate calculation (average spend per day/month with trend direction)
- Projection caching with 24h TTL (balance performance vs freshness)
- Cache invalidation on new transactions (recalculate if material change >5%)
- Confidence interval calculation (80%, 90%, 95% bands around point estimate)
- Multi-horizon forecasts (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months ahead)
- Scenario planning (optimistic: -1σ spend, pessimistic: +1σ spend, expected: mean)
- Historical vs projected visualization (chart showing actual + forecast)
- Goal deadline alerts (notify user 30d, 7d, 1d before goal deadline)

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced ML models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM neural networks) - v2 feature for high-volume users
- External data integration (stock market, economic indicators) - v2 feature
- Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty quantification - v2 feature
- Multi-account consolidated forecasting - covered in separate vertical 4.x
- What-if scenario editor ("what if I reduce dining by 20%?") - v2 interactive feature
- Real-time streaming updates (<1 minute latency) - batch processing acceptable (24h cache)
- Automated goal creation based on patterns - manual creation only in v1

**Boundaries:**
- Forecasting depends on historical transactions from Group 1 (Upload, Extraction, Normalization)
- Goal tracking references accounts/categories from Group 3 registries
- Alerts integration with Vertical 4.1 Reminders for goal deadline notifications
- Minimum data requirement: 3 months of transaction history for basic forecast, 12 months for seasonal patterns
- Projection horizon capped at 24 months (diminishing confidence beyond 2 years)
- User can override projection parameters (smoothing constants, confidence level, horizon)

### 2. User Flow (Real Usage)

**Scenario 1: User views income projection for next 3 months (auto-generated)**

User: "I want to see how much income I can expect over the next 3 months based on my historical patterns."

System:
1. User navigates to Forecast dashboard
2. Clicks "Income Projections" tab
3. ForecastChart (IL component) loads with loading skeleton
4. Frontend calls: `GET /api/forecast/projections?metric=income&horizon=3&unit=months`
5. Backend checks ForecastCache:
   - Last calculation: Oct 15, 2024 (9 days ago)
   - TTL: 24h → EXPIRED
   - New transactions since cache: 15 transactions, total amount: $3,200
   - Material change threshold: 5% of monthly average ($5,000 × 0.05 = $250)
   - Change exceeds threshold: Yes ($3,200 > $250)
   - Decision: RECALCULATE
6. ProjectionEngine fetches historical income (last 12 months):
   ```
   Nov 2023: $4,800
   Dec 2023: $5,200
   Jan 2024: $4,900
   Feb 2024: $5,100
   Mar 2024: $5,300
   Apr 2024: $5,400
   May 2024: $5,200
   Jun 2024: $5,600
   Jul 2024: $5,800
   Aug 2024: $5,500
   Sep 2024: $5,700
   Oct 2024: $5,900 (partial month, will be $6,000 estimated)
   ```
7. ProjectionEngine applies Holt-Winters triple exponential smoothing:
   - Detects trend: +$50/month (5% growth rate)
   - Detects seasonality: Q4 typically +8% vs Q2
   - Smoothing constants: α=0.3 (level), β=0.1 (trend), γ=0.2 (seasonality)
8. ProjectionEngine calculates projections:
   ```
   Nov 2024: $6,050 ± $420 (90% CI: $5,630 - $6,470)
   Dec 2024: $6,200 ± $450 (90% CI: $5,750 - $6,650) [Q4 seasonal boost]
   Jan 2025: $6,100 ± $480 (90% CI: $5,620 - $6,580) [Q1 dip expected]
   ```
9. ForecastCache stores result with metadata:

   - Reversible: No (read-only after completion)

2. **ACTIVE → PAUSED:**
   - Trigger: User manually pauses (e.g., temporary financial hardship)
   - Actions: Disable alerts, stop progress tracking, preserve state
   - Reversible: Yes (user can resume)

3. **ACTIVE → CANCELLED:**
   - Trigger: User deletes goal or changes priorities
   - Actions: Archive goal, send cancellation summary, stop all tracking
   - Reversible: No (soft delete, historical record preserved)

4. **PAUSED → ACTIVE:**
   - Trigger: User resumes goal
   - Actions: Re-enable alerts, recalculate required savings rate, resume tracking

```

**State Transitions:**

1. **CALCULATING → FRESH:**
   - Trigger: ProjectionEngine completes calculation
   - Actions: Store result in cache, set TTL = 24h, serve to queued requests
   - Duration: 2-30 seconds (depends on data volume)

2. **FRESH → STALE:**
   - Trigger: TTL expires (24 hours since last calculation)
   - Actions: Mark cache entry as stale, continue serving stale data, trigger async refresh
   - User impact: Minimal (stale data <24h old is acceptable)

3. **FRESH → INVALIDATED:**
   - Trigger: New transaction exceeds material change threshold (>5% of monthly average)
   - Actions: Immediate recalculation, serve old data until new calculation completes
   - User impact: Loading indicator shown, new data within 5 seconds

---

### 4. Edge Cases

**Edge Case 1: Insufficient historical data for forecasting**

**Scenario:** User has only 2 months of transaction history (minimum is 3 months for basic forecast, 12 months for seasonality).

**Behavior:**
- ProjectionEngine detects data insufficiency
- Falls back to simple moving average (2-month average)
- Returns projection with reduced confidence: 60% (vs 90% for full data)
- UI shows warning: "⚠️ Limited data: Projections based on 2 months only. Confidence: 60%. Add more transaction history for better accuracy."
- Disables seasonality detection (requires 12+ months)
- Projections limited to 1 month ahead (vs 12 months with full data)

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "projections": [
    {
      "period": "2024-11",
      "point_estimate": 5200.00,
      "lower_bound": 4500.00,
      "upper_bound": 5900.00,
      "confidence": 0.60,
      "warning": "insufficient_data"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "data_points": 2,
    "algorithm": "simple_moving_average",
    "fallback_reason": "insufficient_data_for_holt_winters"
  }
}
```

**Edge Case 2: Highly volatile income/expenses (high variance)**

**Scenario:** Freelancer with income ranging from $2,000 to $15,000 per month (coefficient of variation > 50%).

**Behavior:**
- ProjectionEngine detects high variance (std dev > 0.5 × mean)
- Widens confidence intervals: 95% instead of 90%
- UI shows warning: "⚠️ High variability detected: Your income varies significantly month-to-month. Projections have wider ranges."
- Offers scenario planning view: Worst month ($2,000), Average month ($7,500), Best month ($15,000)
- Recommends longer forecast horizon (12 months) to smooth volatility

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "projections": [
    {
      "period": "2024-11",
      "point_estimate": 7500.00,
      "lower_bound": 3200.00,
      "upper_bound": 11800.00,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "volatility": "high"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "coefficient_of_variation": 0.62,
    "volatility_level": "high",
    "recommendation": "use_longer_horizon"
  }
}
```

**Edge Case 3: Goal deadline already passed (overdue goal)**

**Scenario:** User created goal to save $10,000 by Oct 1, 2024. Today is Oct 24, 2024. Current balance: $8,500.

**Behavior:**
- GoalStore detects deadline < current date
- Updates goal status to "OVERDUE"
- Calculates shortfall: $1,500 (15% below target)
- Sends notification: "❌ Goal Overdue: Vacation Fund. Target: $10,000. Current: $8,500. Shortfall: $1,500."
- UI shows red badge: "OVERDUE"
- Offers action: "Extend Deadline" or "Mark as Completed (Partial)"
- Does NOT automatically cancel goal (user decides)

**Example Goal State:**
```json
{
  "goal_id": "goal_vacation_789",
  "status": "overdue",
  "target_amount": 10000.00,
  "current_balance": 8500.00,
  "deadline": "2024-10-01T23:59:59Z",
  "overdue_days": 23,
  "shortfall": 1500.00,
  "shortfall_percentage": 15.0,
  "actions_available": ["extend_deadline", "mark_partial_complete", "cancel"]
}
```

**Edge Case 4: Zero or negative burn rate (savings increasing, not decreasing)**

**Scenario:** User's savings account has net positive cash flow (+$500/month). Asking for "cash runway" is nonsensical (infinite runway).

**Behavior:**
- BurnRateCalculator detects burn_rate <= 0
- Returns special response: `"runway": "infinite"`
- UI shows: "✅ No cash runway concern. Your balance is increasing at $500/month."
- Offers alternative view: "Projected Balance Growth" instead of "Cash Runway"
- Chart shows upward trajectory instead of countdown to zero

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "account_id": "acct_savings_456",
  "current_balance": 7700.00,
  "burn_rate_monthly": -500.00,  // Negative = accumulating
  "trend_direction": "accumulating",
  "runway": "infinite",
  "projected_balance_12m": 13700.00,
  "message": "Your balance is increasing. No runway calculation needed."
}
```

**Edge Case 5: Goal with recurring frequency (monthly savings goal)**

**Scenario:** User creates goal: "Save $1,000 every month" (not one-time target).

**Behavior:**
- GoalStore creates recurring goal with frequency = "monthly"
- Each month, system creates new goal instance (similar to Series in Vertical 3.3)
- Tracks: Oct 2024 instance ($1,000 target), Nov 2024 instance, Dec 2024 instance
- Calculates success rate: "3 of last 6 months achieved" (50% success)
- UI shows calendar view with checkmarks (✅) for completed months, (❌) for missed months
- Alerts when current month falling behind: "Oct 2024: $650 saved of $1,000 target (10 days remaining)"

**Example Recurring Goal:**
```json
{
  "goal_id": "goal_monthly_savings_recurring",
  "type": "savings_target",
  "frequency": "monthly",
  "target_amount_per_period": 1000.00,
  "instances": [
    {
      "period": "2024-10",
      "target": 1000.00,
      "actual": 650.00,
      "status": "in_progress",
      "days_remaining": 10
    },
    {
      "period": "2024-09",
      "target": 1000.00,
      "actual": 1100.00,
      "status": "completed"
    },
    {
      "period": "2024-08",
      "target": 1000.00,
      "actual": 850.00,
      "status": "partial_complete"
    }
  ],
  "success_rate": 0.50,
  "current_streak": 1
}
```

**Edge Case 6: Projection horizon exceeds available data (extrapolation risk)**

**Scenario:** User has 6 months of data, requests 24-month projection.

**Behavior:**
- ProjectionEngine allows request but increases uncertainty progressively
- Months 1-6: 90% confidence (interpolation within data range)
- Months 7-12: 80% confidence (short extrapolation)
- Months 13-18: 70% confidence (medium extrapolation)
- Months 19-24: 60% confidence (long extrapolation, high uncertainty)
- UI shows degrading confidence gradient on chart
- Warning: "⚠️ Projections beyond 12 months are highly uncertain with only 6 months of data."

**Edge Case 7: Cache invalidation race condition**

**Scenario:** Two transactions post simultaneously, both trigger cache invalidation. Two ProjectionEngine calculations run concurrently.

**Behavior:**
- ForecastCache uses optimistic locking (version number)
- First calculation to complete: Writes to cache, increments version
- Second calculation completes: Attempts write, detects version mismatch, DISCARDS result
- Prevents duplicate calculations from overwriting each other
- Logs event: "Cache write conflict detected, discarded duplicate calculation"
- User sees only final result from first calculation (no user impact)

**Edge Case 8: Goal target amount changes mid-period**

**Scenario:** User has goal: "Save $10,000 by Dec 31". On Nov 1, user increases target to $15,000 (more ambitious).

**Behavior:**
- GoalStore updates target_amount = $15,000
- Recalculates required savings rate:
  - Old: $2,800 remaining / 68 days = $41/day
  - New: $7,800 remaining / 61 days = $128/day (3× increase!)
- Updates on_track_status from "on_track" to "off_track"
- Sends notification: "⚠️ Goal Updated: Vacation Fund target increased to $15,000. New required savings: $128/day (was $41/day). Projected completion: Feb 2025 (45 days late)."
- UI shows historical target change in audit log
- Chart displays target change as vertical line with annotation

---

### 5. Performance Requirements

**Query Performance:**
- Projection calculation (12 months, Holt-Winters): <5 seconds (99th percentile)
- Projection from cache (FRESH): <200ms (95th percentile)
- Goal progress update (single goal): <100ms
- Burn rate calculation (90 days): <1 second
- Cache invalidation check: <50ms (must be fast to avoid blocking transaction ingestion)

**Throughput:**
- Support 1,000 concurrent users viewing forecasts
- Process 500 goal updates/second (across all users)
- Handle 10,000 cache lookups/second
- Recalculate 100 projections/minute (batch processing)

**Data Volume:**
- Forecast cache: Up to 10,000 cached projections (per user: income, expense, category breakdowns × horizons)
- Goal storage: Support 50 active goals per user (100,000 users = 5M goals)
- Historical data: Efficient queries over 5 years of transactions (100K+ per user)

**Latency Targets:**
- Cache hit: <200ms end-to-end (DB lookup + serialization)
- Cache miss (recalculation): <5s for 12-month projection
- Goal deadline check (scheduled job): Process 100K goals in <10 minutes
- Real-time goal update (transaction posts): <500ms propagation to UI

**Scalability:**
- Horizontal scaling: Projection calculations can run on separate worker nodes
- Cache partitioning: Shard cache by user_id (10 shards = 10× throughput)
- Read replicas: Goal queries can use read replicas (eventual consistency acceptable)

---

### 6. Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies (Group 1: Upload & Ingestion):**
- **Vertical 1.3 Normalization:** Forecasting requires canonical transactions (normalized amounts, dates, categories)
- **CanonicalStore:** Fetch historical transaction data for time series analysis
- **DateNormalizer (Vertical 3.6):** Ensure consistent date handling (UTC vs user timezone)
- **CurrencyConverter (Vertical 3.6):** Multi-currency normalization for accurate projections

**Internal Dependencies (Group 3: Registries):**
- **Vertical 3.1 Account:** Goals reference specific accounts (savings account, checking account)
- **Vertical 3.4 Tax Categorization:** Category-level forecasts (e.g., "Project dining expenses for Q4")
- **Vertical 3.3 Series:** Recurring payment detection feeds into expense forecasting
- **Vertical 3.5 Relationships:** Exclude transfers from burn rate (prevent double-counting)

**Internal Dependencies (Group 4: Derivatives):**
- **Vertical 4.1 Reminders:** Goal deadline alerts, burn rate warnings, off-track notifications
- **AlertRuleEvaluator:** Reuse alert rule engine for goal threshold checks

**External Dependencies:**
- **NumPy/SciPy (Python) or statsmodels:** Holt-Winters exponential smoothing implementation
- **JavaScript libraries:** For frontend (if using JS): simple-statistics, regression.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension (optimized for time series queries) OR standard PostgreSQL with date range indexes

**Optional Dependencies (v2):**
- **Facebook Prophet:** Advanced ML forecasting (requires separate ML service)
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** LSTM neural networks for complex patterns (high-volume users)

### 10. Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Finance - Retirement Savings Projection**

**Context:** User is 35 years old, wants to retire at 65 with $2M in savings. Currently has $250K.

**Inputs:**
- Current balance: $250,000
- Target: $2,000,000
- Deadline: 30 years (2054-10-24)
- Current monthly contribution: $1,500
- Expected annual return: 7% (investment account)

**System Actions:**
1. ProjectionEngine calculates compound growth: FV = PV × (1 + r)^n + PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r]
2. FV = $250K × (1.07)^30 + $1,500/month × compound factor
3. Projected final balance: $2,150,000 ✅ (exceeds target by $150K)
4. Goal status: ON TRACK
5. Recommendation: "You're on track to exceed your goal by $150K. Consider reducing monthly contribution to $1,300 or retiring 2 years early."

**Multi-Domain Example (Healthcare):**
- Hospital budgeting for equipment replacement fund
- Current fund: $250K, Target: $2M for new MRI machine in 5 years
- Monthly budget allocation: $25K
- Projection: $1.75M (shortfall: $250K)
- Recommendation: "Increase monthly allocation to $30K to reach goal"

---

**Scenario 2: E-commerce - Revenue Forecasting with Seasonality**

**Context:** Online retailer wants to project Q4 2024 revenue based on historical sales patterns.

**Inputs:**
- Historical revenue (last 24 months): Shows strong Q4 seasonality (+40% vs Q2)
- Q1 2024: $500K, Q2 2024: $450K, Q3 2024: $480K
- Algorithm: Holt-Winters triple exponential (captures seasonality)

**System Actions:**
1. ProjectionEngine detects seasonal pattern: Q4 = 1.4× Q2 average
2. Calculates trend: +5% year-over-year growth
3. Projects Q4 2024: $680K ± $85K (90% CI: $595K - $765K)
4. Breakdown by month:
   - Oct 2024: $210K (normal)
   - Nov 2024: $230K (Black Friday boost)
   - Dec 2024: $240K (holiday peak)
5. Recommendation: "Stock inventory for $765K peak scenario (upper bound)"

**Multi-Domain Example (Research):**
- University research lab projects grant funding for next fiscal year
- Historical pattern: Large federal grants in Q1 ($400K), smaller foundation grants throughout year
- Projection: Q1 FY2025: $420K (trend: +5%), Q2-Q4: $180K total
- Recommendation: "Ensure cash runway for Q2-Q4 gap (lower funding)"

---

**Scenario 3: SaaS - MRR Projection with Churn**

**Context:** SaaS company wants to project MRR growth accounting for churn rate.

**Inputs:**
- Current MRR: $50,000
- Monthly new MRR: $8,000 (new customers)
- Monthly churn rate: 5% ($2,500 lost)
- Net MRR growth: +$5,500/month

**System Actions:**
1. ProjectionEngine uses linear regression with churn adjustment
2. Formula: MRR(n+1) = MRR(n) + New_MRR - (MRR(n) × Churn_Rate)
3. Projections:
   - Nov 2024: $55,500
   - Dec 2024: $60,775
   - Jan 2025: $65,826
   - 6-month projection: $82,000 (+64% vs current)
4. Burn rate analysis: "At $50K MRR and $80K monthly expenses, you have 8 months runway. You'll reach profitability (MRR > $80K) in 6 months."

**Multi-Domain Example (Legal):**
- Law firm projects billable hours revenue with attorney attrition
- Current monthly billings: $200K
- New client revenue: $30K/month
- Attorney churn: 3 attorneys leaving (lose $20K/month billings)
- Net growth: +$10K/month
- Projection: 6 months → $260K/month

---

**Scenario 4: Healthcare - Patient Volume Forecasting**

**Context:** Clinic wants to project patient visit volume for next quarter to optimize staffing.

**Inputs:**
- Historical visits (last 12 months): Average 450/month, seasonal flu spike in Nov-Feb (+30%)
- Current trend: +3% growth year-over-year (aging population)

**System Actions:**
1. ProjectionEngine applies Holt-Winters with weekly seasonality
2. Detects patterns:
   - Seasonal: Nov-Feb flu season (+30% vs baseline)
   - Weekly: Mondays 20% higher than Fridays
   - Trend: +3% annual growth
3. Projections for Nov-Jan:
   - Nov 2024: 585 visits (450 × 1.30 seasonal × 1.03 trend)
   - Dec 2024: 600 visits (peak flu)
   - Jan 2025: 580 visits (declining flu)
4. Staffing recommendation: "Hire 2 temporary nurses for Nov-Jan to handle +140 visits/month increase"

**Multi-Domain Example (Logistics):**
- Warehouse projects shipment volume for holiday season
- Historical: 10K shipments/month baseline, +60% in Nov-Dec
- Projection: Nov: 16K, Dec: 18K (peak)
- Capacity recommendation: "Lease temporary warehouse space for 8K additional units"

---

**Scenario 5: Research - Grant Funding Runway with Publication Goals**

**Context:** Research lab has $500K grant, $80K/month burn rate, wants to publish 5 papers before funding runs out.

**Inputs:**
- Current balance: $500K
- Monthly burn: $80K (salaries, equipment, overhead)
- Runway: 6.25 months (Feb 2025)
- Goal: Publish 5 papers (currently 2 published, 3 in progress)
- Historical publication rate: 1 paper every 2 months

**System Actions:**
1. BurnRateCalculator: 6.25 months runway
2. GoalStore: Publication goal = 5 papers by Feb 2025
3. Projection:
   - At 1 paper/2 months, expected papers by Feb: 2 (current) + 3 (6 months / 2) = 5 papers ✅
   - Status: ON TRACK (just barely)
4. Risk analysis: "Any delay in publication timeline will exceed grant funding. Consider:
   - Apply for no-cost extension (6-month deadline extension)
   - Submit 2 papers simultaneously in Nov (accelerate timeline)
   - Reduce burn rate by 10% ($72K/month) to extend runway to 7 months (buffer)"

**Multi-Domain Example (E-commerce):**
- Startup has $500K seed funding, $80K/month burn
- Goal: Reach $100K/month revenue before funding runs out
- Current revenue: $30K/month, growing 15%/month
- Projection: Month 5 = $60K, Month 6 = $69K, never reaches $100K before runway ends
- Status: OFF TRACK ⚠️
- Recommendation: "Reduce burn to $60K/month or raise bridge round"

### 14. Pattern Abstraction

The **Forecast** vertical implements a **generic ForecastableMetric<T> interface** that works across all domains:

**Core Abstraction:**

```typescript
/**
 * ForecastableMetric<T> - Generic interface for any time series forecasting
 *
 * Type parameter T represents the metric being forecasted:
 *  - number (e.g., revenue, patient count, case volume)
 *  - { amount: number, currency: string } (multi-currency amounts)
 *  - { value: number, unit: string } (measurements with units)
 */
interface ForecastableMetric<T> {
  metric_type: string;                        // "income", "patient_volume", "shipment_count"
  historical_data: TimeSeriesPoint<T>[];      // Historical observations
  projection_algorithm: ProjectionAlgorithm;  // holt_winters, linear_regression, moving_average
  confidence_interval: number;                // 0.0-1.0 (e.g., 0.90 = 90% confidence)
  forecast_horizon: number;                   // Number of periods ahead
  horizon_unit: TimeUnit;                     // "days", "weeks", "months", "years"
}

interface TimeSeriesPoint<T> {
  timestamp: Date;           // When this data point occurred
  value: T;                  // The observed value (generic type)
  metadata?: {               // Optional context
    source?: string;         // Where data came from
    quality?: number;        // Data quality score 0-1
    outlier?: boolean;       // Flag for anomalous values
  };
}

enum ProjectionAlgorithm {
  HoltWinters = "holt_winters",           // Exponential smoothing (trend + seasonality)
  LinearRegression = "linear_regression", // Simple linear trend
  MovingAverage = "moving_average",       // Rolling average (no trend)
  Auto = "auto"                           // System selects best algorithm
}

enum TimeUnit {
  Days = "days",
  Weeks = "weeks",
  Months = "months",
  Quarters = "quarters",
  Years = "years"
}
```

**Finance Implementation (Concrete):**

```typescript
// Finance: Project income for next 6 months
const incomeMetric: ForecastableMetric<number> = {
  metric_type: "income",
  historical_data: [
    { timestamp: new Date("2024-01-01"), value: 5000 },
    { timestamp: new Date("2024-02-01"), value: 5200 },
    { timestamp: new Date("2024-03-01"), value: 5100 },
    // ... 9 more months
  ],
  projection_algorithm: ProjectionAlgorithm.HoltWinters,
  confidence_interval: 0.90,
  forecast_horizon: 6,
  horizon_unit: TimeUnit.Months
};

const projections = await ProjectionEngine.forecast(incomeMetric);
// Returns: [
//   { period: "2024-11", point_estimate: 6050, lower_bound: 5630, upper_bound: 6470 },
//   { period: "2024-12", point_estimate: 6200, lower_bound: 5750, upper_bound: 6650 },
//   ...
// ]
```

**Healthcare Implementation (Same Interface):**

```typescript
// Healthcare: Project patient visit volume for next 3 months
const patientVolumeMetric: ForecastableMetric<number> = {
  metric_type: "patient_volume",
  historical_data: [
    { timestamp: new Date("2024-01-01"), value: 450, metadata: { source: "EMR" } },
    { timestamp: new Date("2024-02-01"), value: 480, metadata: { source: "EMR" } },
    // ... 10 more months
  ],
  projection_algorithm: ProjectionAlgorithm.HoltWinters,  // Captures flu season seasonality
  confidence_interval: 0.90,
  forecast_horizon: 3,
  horizon_unit: TimeUnit.Months
};

const projections = await ProjectionEngine.forecast(patientVolumeMetric);
// Returns: [
//   { period: "2024-11", point_estimate: 585, lower_bound: 545, upper_bound: 625 },  // Flu season spike
//   { period: "2024-12", point_estimate: 600, lower_bound: 560, upper_bound: 640 },
//   { period: "2025-01", point_estimate: 580, lower_bound: 540, upper_bound: 620 }
// ]
```

**E-commerce Implementation (Same Interface):**

```typescript
// E-commerce: Project revenue for Q4 (with Black Friday seasonality)
const revenueMetric: ForecastableMetric<{ amount: number, currency: string }> = {
  metric_type: "revenue",
  historical_data: [
    { timestamp: new Date("2023-01-01"), value: { amount: 500000, currency: "USD" } },
    { timestamp: new Date("2023-02-01"), value: { amount: 450000, currency: "USD" } },
    // ... 22 more months (2 years of data for seasonality)
  ],
  projection_algorithm: ProjectionAlgorithm.HoltWinters,  // Captures Q4 holiday boost
  confidence_interval: 0.90,
  forecast_horizon: 3,
  horizon_unit: TimeUnit.Months
};

const projections = await ProjectionEngine.forecast(revenueMetric);
// Returns: [
//   { period: "2024-10", point_estimate: { amount: 210000, currency: "USD" }, ... },
//   { period: "2024-11", point_estimate: { amount: 230000, currency: "USD" }, ... },  // Black Friday
//   { period: "2024-12", point_estimate: { amount: 240000, currency: "USD" }, ... }   // Holiday peak
// ]
```

**Goal Tracking Abstraction:**

```typescript
/**
 * Goal<T> - Generic interface for tracking progress toward any target
 *
 * Type parameter T represents the target being tracked:
 *  - number (e.g., savings amount, patient count, case closures)
 *  - { value: number, unit: string } (e.g., { value: 95, unit: "percent" })
 */
interface Goal<T> {
  goal_id: string;
  name: string;
  type: GoalType;                    // "target", "limit", "range"
  target: T;                         // What we're aiming for
  current: T;                        // Current progress
  deadline: Date;
  status: GoalStatus;                // active, completed, overdue, paused
  frequency: GoalFrequency;          // one_time, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly

  // Calculated fields
  progress_percentage: number;       // 0-100
  on_track_status: OnTrackStatus;    // on_track, off_track, at_risk
  required_rate: {                   // How much progress needed per time unit
    value: number;
    unit: TimeUnit;
  };

```

**Research Burn Rate (Grant Funding Runway):**

```typescript

    }
  }
};
```

**Key Insight:** The same 4 primitives (ProjectionEngine, GoalStore, BurnRateCalculator, ForecastCache) work across ALL domains by using **generic type parameters** and **domain-agnostic algorithms**. The only domain-specific code is:
1. **Data fetching** (where to get historical data)
2. **Unit formatting** (display "$5,000" vs "500 patients" vs "800 units")
3. **Business rules** (e.g., finance requires 3 months data, healthcare may require 6 months)

---

### 15. Runner/Coordinator Separation

**Coordinator: ForecastCoordinator (Orchestration Layer)**

The **ForecastCoordinator** is a thin orchestration layer that coordinates between primitives but contains NO business logic. It delegates all calculations to primitives.

**Responsibilities:**
- Route forecast requests to appropriate primitives (ProjectionEngine, BurnRateCalculator)
- Check ForecastCache before triggering recalculations
- Coordinate goal updates with transaction events (when new transaction posts, update goals)
- Trigger alerts via Vertical 4.1 Reminders when goals off track
- Log all operations for observability

**Anti-Pattern (What Coordinator Does NOT Do):**
- ❌ Does NOT implement forecasting algorithms (delegates to ProjectionEngine)
- ❌ Does NOT calculate goal progress (delegates to GoalStore)
- ❌ Does NOT compute burn rates (delegates to BurnRateCalculator)
- ❌ Does NOT validate inputs (delegates to each primitive's validation)

**Example Coordinator Implementation:**

```typescript
class ForecastCoordinator {
  constructor(
    private projectionEngine: ProjectionEngine,
    private goalStore: GoalStore,
    private burnRateCalculator: BurnRateCalculator,
    private forecastCache: ForecastCache,
    private reminderEngine: ReminderEngine,  // From Vertical 4.1
    private logger: Logger
  ) {}

  /**
   * Handle forecast projection request
   *
   * Orchestration logic:
   * 1. Check cache (delegate to ForecastCache)
   * 2. If miss, calculate (delegate to ProjectionEngine)
   * 3. Store result (delegate to ForecastCache)
   * 4. Return to caller
   */
  async getProjection(request: ProjectionRequest): Promise<ProjectionResponse> {
    this.logger.info("ForecastCoordinator.getProjection", { request });

    // Step 1: Check cache
    const cached = await this.forecastCache.get(request);
    if (cached && !request.force_recalculate) {
      this.logger.info("Cache hit", { cache_key: cached.cache_key });
      return cached;
    }

    // Step 2: Calculate (delegate to ProjectionEngine)
    this.logger.info("Cache miss, calculating projection");
    const projection = await this.projectionEngine.forecast(request);

    // Step 3: Store in cache
    await this.forecastCache.set(request, projection);

    // Step 4: Return
    return projection;
  }

  /**
   * Handle new transaction event (update goals, invalidate cache)
   *
   * Orchestration logic:
   * 1. Invalidate cache if material change
   * 2. Update affected goals (delegate to GoalStore)
   * 3. Check if any goals now off track (trigger alerts)
   */
  async onTransactionCreated(transaction: Transaction): Promise<void> {
    this.logger.info("ForecastCoordinator.onTransactionCreated", { transaction_id: transaction.id });

    // Step 1: Invalidate cache if material change (delegate to ForecastCache)
    await this.forecastCache.invalidateIfMaterial(transaction);

    // Step 2: Update affected goals (delegate to GoalStore)
    const affectedGoals = await this.goalStore.updateGoalsForTransaction(transaction);

    // Step 3: Check for off-track goals and trigger alerts (delegate to ReminderEngine)
    for (const goal of affectedGoals) {
      if (goal.on_track_status === OnTrackStatus.OffTrack) {
        await this.reminderEngine.createNotification({
          type: "goal_off_track",
          severity: "warning",
          title: `Goal Off Track: ${goal.name}`,
          body: `Your goal is now ${goal.shortfall_percentage}% off track. Adjust contributions or extend deadline.`,
          metadata: { goal_id: goal.goal_id }
        });
      }
    }
  }

  /**
   * Handle scheduled goal deadline check (daily cron job)
   *
   * Orchestration logic:
   * 1. Fetch goals with upcoming deadlines (delegate to GoalStore)
   * 2. For each goal, trigger deadline reminder (delegate to ReminderEngine)
   */
  async checkGoalDeadlines(): Promise<void> {
    this.logger.info("ForecastCoordinator.checkGoalDeadlines - running scheduled job");

    // Step 1: Fetch goals with deadlines in next 30 days (delegate to GoalStore)
    const upcomingDeadlines = await this.goalStore.getGoalsWithDeadlinesInRange(
      new Date(),
      addDays(new Date(), 30)
    );

    // Step 2: For each goal, create deadline reminder (delegate to ReminderEngine)
    for (const goal of upcomingDeadlines) {
      const daysRemaining = differenceInDays(goal.deadline, new Date());

      // Check if we should send reminder (30d, 7d, 1d before)
      if ([30, 7, 1].includes(daysRemaining)) {
        await this.reminderEngine.createNotification({
          type: "goal_deadline_approaching",
          severity: "info",
          title: `Goal Deadline in ${daysRemaining} Days: ${goal.name}`,
          body: `Your goal "${goal.name}" is due ${format(goal.deadline, 'MMM dd, yyyy')}. Current progress: ${goal.progress_percentage}%.`,
          metadata: { goal_id: goal.goal_id, days_remaining: daysRemaining }
        });
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Runner: ProjectionEngine (Business Logic Layer)**

The **ProjectionEngine** is a runner that contains ALL forecasting business logic. It is called by the coordinator but operates independently.

**Responsibilities:**
- Implement forecasting algorithms (Holt-Winters, linear regression, moving average)
- Detect trends and seasonality in historical data
- Calculate confidence intervals
- Validate input data quality (sufficient data points, no missing periods)
- Return structured projection results

**Example Runner Implementation (Simplified):**

```typescript
class ProjectionEngine {
  /**
   * Generate forecast projection using best available algorithm
   *
   * Business logic:
   * 1. Validate input data (sufficient points, no gaps)
   * 2. Select algorithm (Holt-Winters if seasonality detected, else linear regression)
   * 3. Calculate projections with confidence intervals
   * 4. Return structured result
   */
  async forecast(request: ProjectionRequest): Promise<ProjectionResponse> {
    // Step 1: Fetch historical data
    const historicalData = await this.fetchHistoricalData(request);

    // Step 2: Validate data quality
    this.validateDataQuality(historicalData, request);

    // Step 3: Select algorithm
    const algorithm = this.selectAlgorithm(historicalData, request.algorithm);

    // Step 4: Calculate projections (THIS IS WHERE BUSINESS LOGIC LIVES)
    const projections = await this.calculateProjections(
      historicalData,
      algorithm,
      request.horizon,
      request.confidence_level
    );

    // Step 5: Return structured response
    return {
      projection_id: this.generateProjectionId(request),
      algorithm_used: algorithm,
      projections: projections,
      metadata: {
        data_points: historicalData.length,
        trend: this.detectTrend(historicalData),
        seasonality_detected: this.detectSeasonality(historicalData)
      }
    };
  }

  /**
   * Core algorithm: Holt-Winters triple exponential smoothing
   *
   * This method contains PURE business logic (no orchestration, no I/O)
   */
  private calculateHoltWinters(
    data: number[],
    horizon: number,
    alpha: number = 0.3,   // Level smoothing
    beta: number = 0.1,    // Trend smoothing
    gamma: number = 0.2    // Seasonality smoothing
  ): number[] {
    // Initialize level, trend, seasonal components
    let level = data[0];
    let trend = (data[1] - data[0]);
    const seasonalPeriod = 12;  // Monthly data, 12-month cycle
    const seasonal = this.initializeSeasonalComponents(data, seasonalPeriod);

    const forecasts: number[] = [];

    // Apply Holt-Winters recursion
    for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
      const seasonalIndex = i % seasonalPeriod;

      // Update level
      const newLevel = alpha * (data[i] / seasonal[seasonalIndex]) +
                       (1 - alpha) * (level + trend);

      // Update trend
      const newTrend = beta * (newLevel - level) + (1 - beta) * trend;

      // Update seasonal
      seasonal[seasonalIndex] = gamma * (data[i] / newLevel) +
                                (1 - gamma) * seasonal[seasonalIndex];

      level = newLevel;
      trend = newTrend;
    }

    // Generate future projections
    for (let h = 1; h <= horizon; h++) {
      const seasonalIndex = (data.length + h - 1) % seasonalPeriod;
      const forecast = (level + h * trend) * seasonal[seasonalIndex];
      forecasts.push(forecast);
    }

    return forecasts;
  }
}
```

**Key Separation:**
- **Coordinator** (ForecastCoordinator): Thin orchestration, no business logic, delegates to runners
- **Runners** (ProjectionEngine, GoalStore, BurnRateCalculator): Thick business logic, no orchestration, pure calculations

This separation allows:
1. **Independent testing:** Test ProjectionEngine algorithms in isolation (unit tests with mock data)
2. **Reusability:** Use ProjectionEngine directly from other verticals without coordinator
3. **Maintainability:** Business logic changes don't affect orchestration flow
4. **Scalability:** Run calculation-heavy runners on separate worker nodes

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns (Sections 16-20)

### 16. Security Considerations

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- All forecast endpoints require authenticated user session (JWT token)
- User can only access their own projections, goals, burn rate analyses
- Authorization check: `user_id` in request token must match `user_id` in forecast data
- API returns `403 Forbidden` if user attempts to access another user's forecasts

**Data Privacy:**
- Projections contain sensitive financial data (income amounts, account balances)
- All responses encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS 1.3)
- Database fields encrypted at rest (PostgreSQL pgcrypto extension)
- Audit log: Record who accessed which forecasts when (GDPR compliance)

**Input Validation (Prevent Injection Attacks):**
- All user inputs sanitized (prevent SQL injection via `account_id` parameter)
- Use parameterized queries: `SELECT * FROM goals WHERE user_id = $1 AND goal_id = $2`
- Reject requests with invalid date formats (prevent NoSQL injection)
- Rate limiting: Max 100 forecast requests per minute per user (prevent DoS)

**Cache Security:**
- Cache keys include `user_id` to prevent cross-user data leakage
- Cache entries expire after 24h (reduce exposure window)
- If cache compromised, attacker only sees 24h-old projections (limited damage)
- Consider encryption for cached projections (v2 feature for high-security deployments)

**Third-Party Dependencies:**
- If using external forecasting libraries (NumPy, statsmodels), pin versions to avoid supply chain attacks
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities (npm audit, Snyk)
- Sandboxed execution for user-provided formulas (v2 feature: custom projection formulas)

**GDPR Compliance:**
- User can request deletion of all forecast data (`DELETE /api/users/me/forecasts`)
- Cascade delete: Goals, projections, cache entries all deleted
- Export functionality: User can download all forecast history as JSON (`GET /api/users/me/forecasts/export`)
- Retention policy: Forecasts older than 2 years automatically archived to cold storage

### 17. Performance Characteristics

**Latency Benchmarks (Target vs Actual):**

| Operation | Target Latency (p95) | Actual Latency (p95) | Bottleneck |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Projection (cached) | <200ms | 180ms | Database query for cache lookup |
| Projection (recalculate, 12 months) | <5s | 3.2s | Holt-Winters algorithm (CPU-bound) |
| Goal progress update | <100ms | 85ms | Database transaction (INSERT + UPDATE) |
| Burn rate calculation (90 days) | <1s | 750ms | Aggregate query over transactions table |
| Cache invalidation check | <50ms | 35ms | Simple comparison (transaction amount vs threshold) |

**Throughput Benchmarks (Production Load):**

| Metric | Target | Actual | Optimization |
|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Concurrent users (forecast viewing) | 1,000 | 1,200 | Read replicas + cache |
| Goal updates/second (all users) | 500 | 600 | Batch updates every 5 seconds |
| Cache lookups/second | 10,000 | 12,000 | Redis cluster (3 nodes) |
| Projections recalculated/minute | 100 | 120 | Background workers (10 nodes) |

**Scalability Limits:**

| Component | Current Limit | Scaling Strategy |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Single ProjectionEngine instance | 20 concurrent calculations | Horizontal scaling: Add worker nodes (10× capacity) |
| ForecastCache (single Redis instance) | 100K cached projections | Redis cluster sharding by user_id (10× capacity) |
| GoalStore (PostgreSQL) | 10M goals | Table partitioning by user_id (100× capacity) |
| BurnRateCalculator | 500 runway calculations/second | Async job queue (decouple from request/response) |

**Optimization Techniques Applied:**

1. **Cache-Aside Pattern:**
   - Check cache before calculation (95% hit rate in production)
   - Reduces DB load by 20× (2,000 queries/min → 100 queries/min)

2. **Database Indexing:**
   - Composite index on `(user_id, metric_type, calculated_at)` for cache lookups
   - Range index on `(user_id, deadline)` for goal deadline queries
   - BRIN index on `transaction_date` for time series queries (10× faster aggregates)

3. **Batch Processing:**
   - Goal progress updates batched every 5 seconds (reduces DB writes by 50×)
   - Deadline checks run once daily at 8 AM (vs real-time checking)

4. **Parallel Computation:**
   - ProjectionEngine calculates multiple horizons in parallel (6-month + 12-month simultaneously)
   - BurnRateCalculator computes 3 scenarios concurrently (optimistic, expected, pessimistic)

5. **Data Compression:**
   - Cache entries compressed with gzip (70% size reduction: 5KB → 1.5KB)
   - Reduces cache memory usage from 500MB to 150MB (3.3× more capacity)

**Performance Monitoring (Observability):**
- Metrics tracked: p50, p95, p99 latencies for all operations
- Alerts triggered if p95 latency exceeds target by 50%
- Dashboard shows: cache hit rate, recalculation frequency, query duration breakdown

---

### 18. Observability

**Logging Strategy:**

All forecast operations logged with structured JSON for querying:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-10-24T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "forecast",
  "operation": "ProjectionEngine.forecast",
  "user_id": "user123",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "metric_type": "income",
  "horizon_months": 6,
  "cache_hit": false,
  "calculation_time_ms": 3200,
  "algorithm_used": "holt_winters",
  "data_points": 13,
  "warnings": [],
  "metadata": {
    "confidence_level": 0.90,
    "seasonality_detected": true
  }
}
```

**Key Logs to Monitor:**

1. **Cache Performance:**
   - `ForecastCache.get` - cache hit/miss ratio
   - `ForecastCache.invalidate` - invalidation frequency (should be <5% of requests)
   - `ForecastCache.recalculate` - recalculation triggers (material change vs TTL expiration)

2. **Projection Quality:**
   - `ProjectionEngine.forecast` - algorithm selected (Holt-Winters vs fallback)
   - `ProjectionEngine.validate` - data quality warnings (insufficient data, high variance)
   - `ProjectionEngine.confidence` - confidence level achieved (target: ≥0.85)

3. **Goal Tracking:**
   - `GoalStore.create` - goal creation rate (monitor for spam)
   - `GoalStore.updateProgress` - progress update frequency (should be real-time <5s delay)
   - `GoalStore.checkDeadlines` - deadline alert triggers (verify alerts sent)

4. **Errors:**
   - `ERROR` level logs - any exceptions, timeouts, validation failures
   - `WARN` level logs - insufficient data, high variance, cache misses

**Metrics Exported (Prometheus Format):**

```prometheus
# Cache performance
forecast_cache_hit_rate{user_id="user123"} 0.94
forecast_cache_miss_rate{user_id="user123"} 0.06

3. **User Engagement Dashboard:**
   - Chart: Forecast views per day
   - Chart: Goal creation rate
   - Funnel: Forecast view → Goal creation → Goal completion (conversion rate)

**Alerts:**

2. **Cache Inefficiency:**
   - Trigger: Cache hit rate <80% (target: >90%)
   - Action: Increase TTL, reduce invalidation threshold, investigate cache eviction

3. **Goal Alert Failures:**
   - Trigger: Deadline alerts not sent (missed cron job)
   - Action: Investigate cron scheduler, verify ReminderEngine integration

4. **Data Quality Issues:**
   - Trigger: >20% of projections have "insufficient_data" warning
   - Action: Prompt users to upload more historical data, lower minimum data threshold

**Tracing (Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry):**

Full request trace from API call → projection calculation:

```
Span: GET /api/forecast/projections (total: 3.5s)
  ├─ Span: ForecastCoordinator.getProjection (3.5s)
  │   ├─ Span: ForecastCache.get (150ms) [cache miss]
  │   ├─ Span: ProjectionEngine.forecast (3.2s)
  │   │   ├─ Span: fetchHistoricalData (800ms)
  │   │   │   └─ Span: PostgreSQL query (750ms)
  │   │   ├─ Span: validateDataQuality (50ms)
  │   │   ├─ Span: calculateHoltWinters (2.1s) [CPU-bound]
  │   │   └─ Span: calculateConfidenceIntervals (200ms)
  │   └─ Span: ForecastCache.set (100ms)
  └─ Span: serializeResponse (50ms)
```

This trace reveals:
- 800ms spent fetching historical data (23% of total time) → optimize query
- 2.1s spent in Holt-Winters algorithm (60% of total time) → consider caching intermediate results

### 19. Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Isolated Component Testing):**

1. **ProjectionEngine Tests:**
   - Test Holt-Winters algorithm with known dataset (expected output pre-calculated)
   - Test linear regression fallback (insufficient data for Holt-Winters)
   - Test moving average baseline (3-month, 6-month, 12-month)
   - Test confidence interval calculation (verify 90% CI width)
   - Test seasonality detection (12-month periodic pattern)
   - Test trend detection (increasing, decreasing, stable)
   - Edge case: Empty dataset → reject with error
   - Edge case: Single data point → reject with error
   - Edge case: High variance (CV >50%) → widen confidence intervals

2. **GoalStore Tests:**
   - Test goal CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Test progress calculation (current / target × 100)
   - Test on-track status logic (projected completion < deadline)
   - Test required savings rate calculation (amount_remaining / days_remaining)
   - Test recurring goal instance creation (monthly goal → 12 instances)
   - Edge case: Deadline in past → status = overdue
   - Edge case: Target amount = 0 → reject with error
   - Edge case: Concurrent updates → optimistic lock conflict

3. **BurnRateCalculator Tests:**
   - Test burn rate calculation (total expenses / days)
   - Test runway calculation (balance / burn_rate)
   - Test trend detection (accelerating, stable, decelerating)
   - Test scenario generation (optimistic, expected, pessimistic)
   - Edge case: Zero balance → runway = 0
   - Edge case: Negative burn rate (accumulating) → runway = infinite
   - Edge case: No expenses in lookback period → burn_rate = 0

4. **ForecastCache Tests:**
   - Test cache get (hit vs miss)
   - Test cache set (store projection)
   - Test TTL expiration (24h → stale)
   - Test invalidation on material change (transaction amount >5% threshold)
   - Test optimistic locking (concurrent writes)
   - Edge case: Cache corruption (invalid JSON) → delete and recalculate
   - Edge case: Cache full → evict least recently used (LRU)

**Integration Tests (Multi-Component Workflows):**

1. **End-to-End Forecast Workflow:**
   - User requests 6-month income projection
   - System checks cache (miss)
   - System fetches historical data from CanonicalStore
   - System calculates projection with Holt-Winters
   - System stores result in cache
   - System returns projection to user
   - Verify: Response matches expected format (point estimates, confidence intervals)

2. **Goal Tracking Workflow:**
   - User creates savings goal ($10K by Dec 31)
   - System calculates required savings rate ($41/day)
   - User deposits $500 (Oct 30)
   - System detects new transaction
   - System updates goal progress (72% → 77%)
   - System recalculates on-track status (still on track)
   - User receives real-time UI update via WebSocket
   - Verify: Goal progress updates within 5 seconds of transaction

3. **Goal Deadline Alert Workflow:**
   - User has goal with deadline in 30 days
   - Cron job runs at 8 AM
   - System queries goals with upcoming deadlines
   - System triggers alert via Vertical 4.1 Reminders
   - User receives email + in-app notification
   - Verify: Alert sent within 1 minute of cron job execution

4. **Cache Invalidation Workflow:**
   - User has cached projection (income for Nov 2024)
   - User uploads new bank statement (+$3,200 income)
   - System normalizes transactions
   - ForecastCache checks material change threshold (5% of $5,000 = $250)
   - $3,200 > $250 → INVALIDATE cache
   - System triggers recalculation
   - User requests projection again → sees updated forecast
   - Verify: New projection reflects recent income

**Load Tests (Performance Under Scale):**

1. **Concurrent Projection Requests:**
   - Simulate 1,000 concurrent users requesting projections
   - Target: p95 latency <5s, p99 latency <10s
   - Verify: Cache hit rate >90% (most requests served from cache)
   - Verify: No database connection pool exhaustion

2. **Goal Update Throughput:**
   - Simulate 500 goal updates/second (across all users)
   - Target: All updates processed within 5 seconds
   - Verify: No deadlocks, no lost updates (optimistic locking works)

3. **Cache Invalidation Storm:**
   - Simulate 10,000 new transactions posted simultaneously (batch upload)
   - Target: All cache invalidations processed within 1 minute
   - Verify: No duplicate recalculations (race condition handling works)

**End-to-End Tests (User Journey Simulation):**

1. **New User Onboarding:**
   - New user signs up, uploads 6 months of transaction history
   - User navigates to Forecast dashboard
   - System displays warning: "Limited data (6 months). Add more for better accuracy."
   - User creates first savings goal ($5K by Dec 31)
   - User receives confirmation: "Goal created. Required: $50/day."
   - Verify: User sees projection with 80% confidence (reduced due to limited data)

2. **Power User Workflow:**
   - User with 24 months of data requests 12-month projection
   - System applies Holt-Winters (seasonality detected)
   - User creates 5 concurrent goals (savings, income, spending limits)
   - User tracks progress weekly via email summaries
   - User receives alert: "Dining goal exceeded by 15%"
   - Verify: All features work seamlessly for high-volume user

**Regression Tests (Prevent Breaking Changes):**

1. **Algorithm Stability:**
   - Test Holt-Winters with same dataset used in v1
   - Verify: Output identical to v1 (no regression in algorithm)
   - If algorithm updated, document changes in release notes

2. **API Contract Stability:**
   - Test all API endpoints with v1 request format
   - Verify: v2 API accepts v1 requests (backward compatibility)
   - Verify: v2 API returns v1-compatible responses (optional fields added, no fields removed)

**Test Coverage Targets:**

- Unit tests: 90% line coverage, 80% branch coverage
- Integration tests: Cover all critical workflows (forecast, goal tracking, alerts)
- Load tests: Run before every production deployment (catch performance regressions)
- End-to-end tests: Cover top 10 user journeys (based on analytics)

**Deployment Steps (Blue-Green Deployment):**

1. **Deploy to Green Environment:**
   - Spin up new API servers (v2) in green environment
   - Run smoke tests (health check endpoints)
   - Verify database migrations applied (alembic/flyway)

2. **Canary Release (10% Traffic):**
   - Route 10% of traffic to green environment
   - Monitor error rates, latency, cache hit rate
   - If metrics healthy, proceed. If issues, rollback to blue.

3. **Full Cutover (100% Traffic):**
   - Route 100% of traffic to green environment
   - Keep blue environment running for 24h (rollback safety)
   - After 24h, decommission blue environment

**Database Migrations:**

**Migration 001: Create forecast_cache table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE forecast_cache (
  cache_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  cache_key VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  metric_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  horizon_months INTEGER NOT NULL,
  calculated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  ttl_expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  algorithm VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  confidence_level DECIMAL(3,2) NOT NULL,
  projection_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, cache_key)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_cache_user_metric ON forecast_cache(user_id, metric_type, calculated_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_cache_expiry ON forecast_cache(ttl_expires_at);  -- For cleanup job
```

**Migration 002: Create goals table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE goals (
  goal_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('savings_target', 'income_target', 'spending_limit')),
  target_amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
  target_currency VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
  account_id UUID REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  deadline TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  starting_balance DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
  current_balance DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
  frequency VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'one_time',
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  progress_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  on_track_status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'on_track',
  alert_config JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,  -- Optimistic locking
  UNIQUE(user_id, name)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_goals_user_status ON goals(user_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_goals_deadline ON goals(user_id, deadline);
```

**Rollback Plan:**

If critical issue detected post-deployment:

1. **Immediate Traffic Cutover:** Route 100% traffic back to blue environment (30 seconds)
2. **Investigate Issue:** Review logs, metrics, error traces
3. **Hotfix or Revert:** Either deploy hotfix to green, or revert code changes
4. **Database Rollback (if needed):** Revert migrations (only if schema change caused issue)

**Monitoring & Alerting (Post-Deployment):**

**Critical Alerts (PagerDuty):**
- API error rate >5% (5xx errors)
- p95 latency >10s (target: <5s)
- Database connection pool exhausted
- Cache cluster node down (2/3 nodes healthy = warning, 1/3 = critical)

**Warning Alerts (Slack):**
- Cache hit rate <80% (target: >90%)
- Goal deadline alerts not sent (cron job failure)
- Projection calculation timeout rate >1%

**Operational Runbooks:**

**Runbook 1: Cache Cluster Node Failure**

**Symptoms:**
- Redis node unhealthy (health check fails)
- Cache hit rate drops to 66% (traffic redistributed to 2 nodes)

**Investigation:**
1. Check Redis logs: `kubectl logs redis-node-2`
2. Check memory usage: `redis-cli INFO memory`
3. Check network: `ping redis-node-2`

**Remediation:**
1. If memory exhaustion: Increase cache size or reduce TTL (24h → 12h)
2. If network issue: Restart pod `kubectl delete pod redis-node-2`
3. If persistent failure: Scale up cluster (3 nodes → 5 nodes)

**Runbook 2: Projection Calculation Timeout**

**Symptoms:**
- User reports: "Forecast loading forever"
- Logs show: `CALCULATION_TIMEOUT` errors

**Investigation:**
1. Check dataset size: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions WHERE user_id = 'user123'`
2. Check algorithm: `SELECT algorithm_used FROM forecast_cache WHERE user_id = 'user123'`
3. Check worker node CPU: `kubectl top nodes`

**Remediation:**
1. If large dataset (>100K transactions): Use sampling (random 10K transactions)
2. If Holt-Winters timeout: Force fallback to linear regression (`algorithm=linear_regression`)
3. If worker overloaded: Scale up worker nodes (10 → 20 nodes)

**Capacity Planning:**

**Current Capacity (Production):**
- API Servers: 3 nodes × 100 req/s = 300 req/s total
- Cache: 3 Redis nodes × 50K cached projections = 150K total
- Workers: 10 nodes × 20 calculations/min = 200 calculations/min total

**Growth Projections:**
- User base: 100K → 500K users (5× growth in 12 months)
- Forecast requests: 1M/month → 5M/month (5× growth)
- Required capacity: 1,500 req/s API (5× current), 750K cache (5× current), 1,000 calculations/min (5× current)

**Scaling Plan:**
- API Servers: 3 nodes → 15 nodes (5× scale)
- Cache: 3 nodes → 10 nodes (3× scale + larger instances)
- Workers: 10 nodes → 50 nodes (5× scale)
- Database: Add read replicas (2 → 5), consider partitioning by user_id

**Cost Optimization:**

1. **Cache TTL Tuning:** Increase TTL from 24h to 48h (reduces recalculations by 50%, saves $2K/month in compute)
2. **Algorithm Selection:** Use linear regression for short-term projections (<3 months) instead of Holt-Winters (10× faster, saves $1K/month)
3. **Async Job Queue:** Decouple projection calculations from request/response (reduce API server load, scale workers independently)
4. **Database Query Optimization:** Materialized views for common aggregates (historical income by month) → 5× faster queries
