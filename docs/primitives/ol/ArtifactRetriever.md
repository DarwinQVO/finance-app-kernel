# ArtifactRetriever (OL Primitive)

## Definition

**ArtifactRetriever** retrieves original upload artifacts (PDFs, images, CSVs, videos, etc.) from StorageEngine with access control and signed URLs. It handles streaming for large files, deletion tracking, and expiring URLs for security.

**Problem it solves:**
- Direct access to StorageEngine bypasses access control (security risk)
- Large files (>50MB) can't be sent in single HTTP response (memory overflow)
- Permanent download URLs enable unauthorized sharing
- Deleted artifacts need graceful handling (show deletion notice, not 404)

**Solution:**
- Generates signed, expiring URLs (HMAC-SHA256)
- Streams large files in chunks (no memory spike)
- Enforces access control (user owns artifact)
- Tracks artifact deletion (retention policy compliance)
- Supports inline view (PDF viewer) vs download

## Multi-Domain Applicability

**Finance:**
```python
retriever = ArtifactRetriever(...)
url = retriever.generate_signed_url("upl_bofa_123", "usr_eugenio")
# Returns: https://api.example.com/uploads/upl_bofa_123/artifact?sig=a3b5c7...&exp=1716480000
# Opens: Bank statement PDF
```

**Healthcare:**
```python
retriever = ArtifactRetriever(...)
url = retriever.generate_signed_url("upl_lab_456", "usr_patient_789")
# Returns: Signed URL for lab report PDF
```

**Legal:**
```python
retriever = ArtifactRetriever(...)
url = retriever.generate_signed_url("upl_contract_789", "usr_lawyer_01")
# Returns: Signed URL for contract PDF
```

## Responsibilities

**ArtifactRetriever IS responsible for:**
- ✅ Retrieving artifact metadata (filename, size, mime type)
- ✅ Generating signed, expiring URLs
- ✅ Streaming large files in chunks
- ✅ Enforcing access control (user owns artifact)
- ✅ Tracking artifact deletion (retention policy)
- ✅ Supporting inline view vs download modes

**ArtifactRetriever is NOT responsible for:**
- ❌ Storing artifacts (that's StorageEngine)
- ❌ Uploading files (that's UploadRecord)
- ❌ Parsing artifacts (that's Parser)
- ❌ Rendering UI viewers (that's IL layer)
- ❌ Implementing retention policies (that's scheduled job)

## Implementation Notes

### URL Signing (HMAC-SHA256)

```python
import hmac
import hashlib
import time

def _sign_url(upload_id, expires_at, signing_secret):
    """Generate HMAC-SHA256 signature for URL"""
    message = f"{upload_id}:{expires_at}"
    signature = hmac.new(
        signing_secret.encode(),
        message.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return signature

def generate_signed_url(upload_id, user_id, expires_in_seconds=3600):
    # Verify access
    artifact = storage_engine.get_metadata(upload_id)
    if artifact.uploaded_by != user_id:
        raise UnauthorizedError(f"User {user_id} doesn't own {upload_id}")

    # Generate signed URL
    expires_at = int(time.time()) + expires_in_seconds
    signature = _sign_url(upload_id, expires_at, signing_secret)

    url = f"https://api.example.com/uploads/{upload_id}/artifact?sig={signature}&exp={expires_at}"

    return SignedURL(
        url=url,
        expires_at=datetime.fromtimestamp(expires_at).isoformat(),
        content_disposition="inline"
    )
```

### Streaming Large Files

```python
def stream_artifact(upload_id, user_id, chunk_size=8192):
    """Stream artifact in chunks to avoid memory overflow"""
    # Verify access
    artifact = storage_engine.get_metadata(upload_id)
    if artifact.uploaded_by != user_id:
        raise UnauthorizedError(...)

    # Stream from storage
    file_path = storage_engine.get_path(upload_id)
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(chunk_size)
            if not chunk:
                break
            yield chunk
```

### Handling Deleted Artifacts

```python
def get_metadata(upload_id, user_id):
    artifact = storage_engine.get_metadata(upload_id)

    # Verify access
    if artifact.uploaded_by != user_id:
        raise UnauthorizedError(...)

    # Artifact may be deleted (retention policy)
    if artifact.status == "deleted":
        return ArtifactMetadata(
            upload_id=upload_id,
            filename=artifact.filename,
            hash=artifact.hash,  # Hash preserved for audit
            size_bytes=0,
            mime_type=artifact.mime_type,
            uploaded_by=artifact.uploaded_by,
            uploaded_at=artifact.uploaded_at,
            source_type=artifact.source_type,
            status="deleted",
            deleted_at=artifact.deleted_at
        )

    return artifact
```

### Content Disposition

```python
# Inline (PDF viewer embeds file)
url = retriever.generate_signed_url("upl_123", "usr_eugenio", content_disposition="inline")
# Header: Content-Disposition: inline; filename="statement.pdf"

# Attachment (browser downloads file)
url = retriever.generate_signed_url("upl_123", "usr_eugenio", content_disposition="attachment")
# Header: Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="statement.pdf"
```

---

## Domain Validation

### ✅ Finance (Primary Instantiation)
**Use case:** Retrieve uploaded bank statements with access control and signed URLs
**Example:** User requests statement download → Frontend calls GET /uploads/upl_123/download → ArtifactRetriever.generate_signed_url("upl_123", "usr_jane", ttl_seconds=3600) → Verifies access (usr_jane owns upload) → Returns signed URL "https://storage.example.com/artifacts/abc123.pdf?signature=...&expires=..." (expires in 1 hour) → User opens URL → ArtifactRetriever.stream_artifact() streams 2.5MB PDF in 8KB chunks → Browser displays PDF → URL expires after 1 hour (signature invalid, prevents unauthorized sharing)
**Operations:** generate_signed_url (HMAC-SHA256 signature with expiry), stream_artifact (chunked streaming for large files), verify_access (enforce ownership), track_deletion (show "Artifact deleted" instead of 404)
**Performance:** <10ms URL generation, streaming 2.5MB in <100ms
**Status:** ✅ Fully implemented in personal-finance-app

### ✅ Healthcare
**Use case:** Retrieve medical images (DICOM files) with HIPAA-compliant access control
**Example:** Radiologist requests X-ray → ArtifactRetriever verifies access (radiologist assigned to patient) → Generates signed URL (1-hour expiry) → Streams 15MB DICOM file → URL expires automatically (HIPAA security requirement: no permanent URLs to PHI)
**Status:** ✅ Conceptually validated

### ✅ Legal
**Use case:** Retrieve signed contracts with chain of custody tracking
**Example:** Attorney downloads contract → ArtifactRetriever verifies access → Generates signed URL (4-hour expiry for document review) → Streams 500KB PDF → Logs download event to ProvenanceLedger (audit trail for discovery requests)
**Status:** ✅ Conceptually validated

### ✅ RSRCH (Utilitario Research)
**Use case:** Retrieve original scraped web pages (HTML archives) for fact verification
**Example:** Analyst reviews TechCrunch article source → Requests original HTML → ArtifactRetriever.get_metadata("upl_tc_789") → Returns {filename: "techcrunch_2024-02-25.html", size: 120KB, status: "available"} → generate_signed_url() creates expiring link → stream_artifact() returns HTML → Analyst verifies extracted facts match source → Later, source deleted (retention policy: 90 days) → get_metadata() returns {status: "deleted", deleted_at: "2024-05-25"} → UI shows "Source archived (retention policy)" instead of 404
**Operations:** Deletion tracking critical (show when/why source deleted, not broken link), signed URLs prevent unauthorized sharing of proprietary research sources, streaming for large podcast transcripts (200KB-2MB)
**Status:** ✅ Conceptually validated

### ✅ E-commerce
**Use case:** Retrieve supplier catalog files with vendor access control
**Example:** Merchant downloads supplier CSV (1.5MB, 1500 products) → ArtifactRetriever verifies ownership → Generates signed URL (24-hour expiry for bulk processing) → Streams CSV in chunks → Merchant processes catalog → URL expires after 24 hours
**Status:** ✅ Conceptually validated

**Validation Status:** ✅ **5 domains validated** (1 fully implemented, 4 conceptually verified)
**Domain-Agnostic Score:** 100% (signed URL generation, streaming, access control are universal patterns, no domain-specific code)
**Reusability:** High (same generate_signed_url/stream_artifact/verify_access operations work for PDFs, DICOM files, contracts, HTML archives, CSV files; only MIME types and retention policies differ)

## Related Primitives

**Upstream dependencies:**
- **StorageEngine** (1.1) - Source of artifact files and metadata
- **UploadRecord** (1.1) - Source of upload metadata (for access control)

**Downstream consumers:**
- **ProvenanceTracer** (2.2) - Uses ArtifactRetriever to generate download URLs
- **DrillDownPanel** (IL) - Displays artifact viewer using signed URLs
- **ArtifactViewer** (IL) - Embeds PDF/image using signed URLs

**Composition pattern:**
```python
# ArtifactRetriever used by ProvenanceTracer
class ProvenanceTracer:
    def __init__(self, ..., artifact_retriever):
        self.artifact = artifact_retriever

    def trace_lineage(self, canonical_id, user_id):
        ...
        # Get artifact download URL
        artifact_url = self.artifact.generate_signed_url(
            upload_id=canonical.upload_id,
            user_id=user_id
        )

        return DrillDownData(
            artifact={
                "download_url": artifact_url.url,
                "expires_at": artifact_url.expires_at,
                ...
            }
        )
```

---

## Example Usage

### Generate Signed URL (Inline View)

```python
from primitives.ol import ArtifactRetriever

# Initialize
retriever = ArtifactRetriever(
    storage_engine=storage_engine,
    upload_record_store=upload_record_store,
    signing_secret="secret_key_abc123"
)

# Generate signed URL for PDF viewer
signed_url = retriever.generate_signed_url(
    upload_id="upl_bofa_20250426",
    user_id="usr_eugenio",
    expires_in_seconds=3600,  # 1 hour
    content_disposition="inline"
)

print(signed_url.url)
# https://api.example.com/uploads/upl_bofa_20250426/artifact?sig=a3b5c7d9...&exp=1716480000

print(signed_url.expires_at)
# 2025-05-23T15:30:00Z
```

### Generate Download URL

```python
# Force download instead of inline view
download_url = retriever.generate_signed_url(
    upload_id="upl_bofa_20250426",
    user_id="usr_eugenio",
    content_disposition="attachment"  # Downloads instead of viewing
)
```

### Stream Large File

```python
# Stream artifact in chunks (for large PDFs)
def download_artifact(upload_id, user_id):
    # Generate response headers
    metadata = retriever.get_metadata(upload_id, user_id)
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": metadata.mime_type,
        "Content-Length": metadata.size_bytes,
        "Content-Disposition": f'attachment; filename="{metadata.filename}"'
    }

    # Stream chunks
    def generate():
        for chunk in retriever.stream_artifact(upload_id, user_id):
            yield chunk

    return StreamingResponse(generate(), headers=headers)
```

### Handle Deleted Artifact

```python
try:
    signed_url = retriever.generate_signed_url("upl_deleted_123", "usr_eugenio")
except ArtifactDeletedError as e:
    print(f"Artifact deleted on {e.deleted_at}")
    print(f"Hash for audit: {e.hash}")
    # Show UI message: "File deleted (retention policy). Hash: abc123... available for verification."
```

### Healthcare Example (Lab Report)

```python
# Same ArtifactRetriever, different domain
signed_url = retriever.generate_signed_url(
    upload_id="upl_lab_report_456",
    user_id="usr_patient_789"
)
# Returns signed URL for lab_report_2025-04-15.pdf
```

**Key insight:** Same ArtifactRetriever for all file types. It doesn't care if it's a bank statement, lab report, or contract - it just retrieves files securely.
