# OL Primitive: HashCalculator

**Type**: Utility / Cryptography
**Domain**: Universal (domain-agnostic)
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Specification

---

## Purpose

Streaming hash calculation for large files without loading entire content into memory. Enables deduplication and integrity verification.

---

## Simplicity Profiles

**This section shows how the same universal primitive is configured differently based on usage scale.**

### Profile 1: Personal Use (Finance App - Small PDFs, ~2MB)

**Context:** Darwin uploads 1-2 bank statements per month (PDFs, ~2MB each) to personal finance app

**Configuration:**
```yaml
hash_calculator:
  algorithm: "sha256"
  chunk_size_kb: 8
  verify_on_retrieve: false  # Trust filesystem integrity
```

**What's Used:**
- ✅ `calculateHash()` - In-memory hashing for small PDFs (<10MB)
- ✅ SHA-256 algorithm - Standard, well-tested
- ✅ Basic deduplication - Same hash = same file

**What's NOT Used:**
- ❌ `calculateHashStreaming()` - Files fit in memory (<10MB)
- ❌ `verifyHash()` on retrieval - Filesystem trusted (no corruption expected)
- ❌ Multi-algorithm support - SHA-256 sufficient
- ❌ Chunk size tuning - Default 8KB works fine
- ❌ Performance metrics - No latency tracking
- ❌ Integrity verification - No re-hashing on retrieval

**Implementation Complexity:** **LOW**
- ~30 lines Python
- Uses stdlib `hashlib.sha256()` only
- No configuration file (hardcoded algorithm)
- No tests (verify manually that dedupe works)

**Narrative Example:**
> Darwin selects "BoFA_Oct2024.pdf" (2.3MB) in upload dialog. The app reads file into memory (2.3MB RAM), calls `HashCalculator.calculateHash(file_bytes)`. The calculator iterates once with `hasher.update(file_bytes)`, returns `sha256:abc123...` in 25ms. Later, Darwin accidentally re-uploads same file. Hash calculated again (`sha256:abc123...`), matches existing → "Already uploaded" message shown. No streaming needed (file fits in RAM).

---

### Profile 2: Small Business (Accounting Firm - Mixed File Sizes, up to 100MB)

**Context:** Accounting firm processes client documents (receipts, tax forms, large scanned PDFs) with files ranging 100KB-100MB

**Configuration:**
```yaml
hash_calculator:
  algorithm: "sha256"
  chunk_size_kb: 16  # Larger chunks for efficiency
  verify_on_retrieve: true  # Detect corruption
  streaming_threshold_mb: 10  # Use streaming for files >10MB
```

**What's Used:**
- ✅ `calculateHash()` - For small files (<10MB)
- ✅ `calculateHashStreaming()` - For large scanned PDFs (>10MB)
- ✅ `verifyHash()` - Re-hash on retrieval to detect corruption
- ✅ Automatic selection - Switch to streaming when file >10MB
- ✅ SHA-256 standard - No custom algorithms needed

**What's NOT Used:**
- ❌ Multi-algorithm support - SHA-256 only
- ❌ Advanced metrics - No Prometheus, just basic logging
- ❌ Custom chunk sizes per file type - Fixed 16KB

**Implementation Complexity:** **MEDIUM**
- ~100 lines Python
- Auto-detects file size, routes to in-memory or streaming
- Basic logging: "Hashing file (streaming=true, size=45MB, latency=450ms)"
- Unit tests: Verify streaming matches in-memory for same file

**Narrative Example:**
> Client uploads tax return PDF (850KB). HashCalculator checks size (< 10MB), uses `calculateHash()` in-memory (5ms). Next client uploads scanned binder (78MB). HashCalculator checks size (> 10MB), uses `calculateHashStreaming()` with 16KB chunks (780ms, O(16KB) memory). Both files stored with hashes. Week later, accountant retrieves 78MB binder. `verifyHash()` re-hashes file → Matches stored hash → No corruption. If mismatch detected → Alert "File corrupted, re-upload needed".

---

### Profile 3: Enterprise (Bank - Large Files, Regulatory Compliance)

**Context:** Bank processes mortgage applications (loan docs, deed scans, appraisals) with files ranging 1MB-500MB, GLBA/SOX compliance requires integrity verification

**Configuration:**
```yaml
hash_calculator:
  algorithm: "sha256"
  fallback_algorithm: "blake2b"  # Future-proofing if SHA-256 broken
  chunk_size_kb: 64  # Optimized for network transfer
  verify_on_retrieve: true  # Always verify (regulatory requirement)
  verify_on_storage: true  # Double-check hash after write
  streaming_threshold_mb: 1  # Always stream (even small files, for consistency)
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    backend: "prometheus"
    labels:
      - document_type
      - file_size_bucket
  logging:
    structured: true
    format: "json"
    level: "info"
    include_hash_prefix: true  # Log first 8 chars for debugging
  integrity_checks:
    detect_known_malware_hashes: true  # Block known malicious files
    quarantine_on_mismatch: true  # Move corrupted files to quarantine
```

**What's Used:**
- ✅ `calculateHashStreaming()` - Always streaming (even 1MB files, for consistency)
- ✅ `verifyHash()` on storage AND retrieval - Double verification (regulatory compliance)
- ✅ Multi-algorithm support - SHA-256 + BLAKE2b fallback (future-proofing)
- ✅ Large chunk size (64KB) - Optimized for S3 network transfer
- ✅ Prometheus metrics - Track p95 latency, hash mismatch rate, malware detections
- ✅ Structured logging - JSON logs with trace IDs, hash prefixes for debugging
- ✅ Malware detection - Check hash against known-bad hash database
- ✅ Quarantine on mismatch - Move corrupted files to separate S3 bucket
- ✅ Integrity verification required - SOX/GLBA compliance (prove file integrity)

**What's NOT Used:**
- ❌ In-memory hashing - Always stream (regulatory requirement for audit trail)

**Implementation Complexity:** **HIGH**
- ~800 lines TypeScript/Python
- Dependencies: Prometheus client, Winston (logging), AWS SDK (S3 integrity checks)
- Malware hash database (updated daily from threat intel feeds)
- Comprehensive test suite: Unit tests, integrity mismatch scenarios, corruption detection
- Monitoring dashboards: Hash calculation latency (p50/p95/p99), mismatch rate (alert if >0.1%), malware detection count
- On-call runbook: P1 incident (integrity check failures spike → investigate S3 corruption/attack)

**Narrative Example:**
> Customer submits mortgage app with 200MB deed scan. API receives upload, streams to `HashCalculator.calculateHashStreaming()`. As 64KB chunks arrive:
> 1. Update SHA-256 hash incrementally (64KB × 3125 iterations = 200MB)
> 2. Log progress every 10%: `{"trace_id":"abc-123","progress":"30%","bytes_hashed":60000000}`
> 3. After final chunk, finalize hash: `sha256:def456...` (calculation took 2.1s)
> 4. Check malware database: Hash not in known-bad list ✅
> 5. Write file to S3, immediately verify: Re-hash from S3 → Matches `sha256:def456...` ✅ (storage integrity confirmed)
> 6. Record Prometheus metrics: `hash_calculation_latency{document_type="deed",file_size_bucket="100-500MB"} 2.1`, `hash_verifications_total{status="success"}++`
> 7. Log structured JSON: `{"trace_id":"abc-123","operation":"hash_calculate","hash":"sha256:def456...","size_bytes":209715200,"latency_ms":2100,"verification":"passed"}`
>
> 10 years later, compliance audit retrieves deed. `verifyHash()` re-hashes from S3 → Hash mismatch! (`sha256:def456...` expected, got `sha256:xyz999...`) → File quarantined to `s3://bank-quarantine/corrupted/`, alert fired: "P1: Integrity failure on deed #12345, possible bit rot or tampering". Compliance officer investigates → S3 bit rot detected → Restores from backup → Re-verifies hash → Passes.

---

**Key Insight:** The same `HashCalculator` interface (`calculateHash`, `verifyHash`) works across all 3 profiles. Personal use stays in-memory for simplicity; Small business adds streaming for large files; Enterprise always streams with double verification and malware checks for compliance.

---

## Interface Contract

```typescript
interface HashCalculator {
  // Calculate hash from bytes (in-memory)
  calculateHash(content: Bytes): Hash

  // Calculate hash from stream (memory-efficient)
  calculateHashStreaming(stream: ReadableStream): Hash

  // Verify hash matches content
  verifyHash(content: Bytes, expected_hash: Hash): boolean
}

type Hash = string  // Format: "sha256:hexdigest"
```

---

## Implementation

### In-Memory (Small Files)

```python
import hashlib

class HashCalculator:
    def __init__(self, algorithm: str = "sha256"):
        self.algorithm = algorithm

    def calculate_hash(self, content: bytes) -> str:
        hasher = hashlib.sha256()
        hasher.update(content)
        digest = hasher.hexdigest()
        return f"sha256:{digest}"
```

---

### Streaming (Large Files)

```python
def calculate_hash_streaming(self, stream: BinaryIO, chunk_size: int = 8192) -> str:
    """
    Calculate hash without loading entire file into memory.

    Memory usage: O(chunk_size) regardless of file size
    """
    hasher = hashlib.sha256()

    while True:
        chunk = stream.read(chunk_size)
        if not chunk:
            break
        hasher.update(chunk)

    digest = hasher.hexdigest()
    return f"sha256:{digest}"
```

**Example usage:**

```python
with open("large_file.pdf", "rb") as f:
    hash = calculator.calculate_hash_streaming(f)
```

---

### Multipart Upload (HTTP Streaming)

```python
def calculate_hash_from_request(request: HTTPRequest) -> str:
    """
    Calculate hash during upload (before saving to disk).
    """
    hasher = hashlib.sha256()

    for chunk in request.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
        hasher.update(chunk)

    return f"sha256:{hasher.hexdigest()}"
```

---

## Configuration

```yaml
hash_calculator:
  algorithm: "sha256"  # or "sha512", "blake2b"
  chunk_size_kb: 8
  verify_on_retrieve: true  # Re-hash on retrieval to detect corruption
```

---

## Performance Characteristics

| File Size | In-Memory | Streaming | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1MB | 5ms | 10ms | Overhead of chunking |
| 10MB | 50ms | 60ms | In-memory starts thrashing |
| 100MB | OOM risk | 600ms | Streaming wins |
| 1GB | ❌ Crash | 6s | Only streaming viable |

**Recommendation**: Always use streaming for files > 10MB

---

## Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Digest Length | Speed | Collision Resistance |
|-----------|---------------|-------|----------------------|
| SHA-256 | 64 hex chars | Fast | Excellent (2^256) |
| SHA-512 | 128 hex chars | Slower | Excellent (2^512) |
| BLAKE2b | 128 hex chars | Fastest | Excellent |
| MD5 | 32 hex chars | Very fast | ❌ Broken (collisions found) |

**Recommendation**: SHA-256 (standard, well-tested, fast enough)

---

## Testing

```python
def test_consistent_hashing():
    content = b"hello world"

    hash1 = calculator.calculate_hash(content)
    hash2 = calculator.calculate_hash(content)

    assert hash1 == hash2

def test_streaming_matches_in_memory():
    content = b"test data" * 10000  # 90KB

    in_memory_hash = calculator.calculate_hash(content)

    stream = BytesIO(content)
    streaming_hash = calculator.calculate_hash_streaming(stream)

    assert in_memory_hash == streaming_hash

def test_known_hash():
    # Verify against known SHA-256 hash
    content = b"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
    expected = "sha256:d7a8fbb307d7809469ca9abcb0082e4f8d5651e46d3cdb762d02d0bf37c9e592"

    assert calculator.calculate_hash(content) == expected
```

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Collision Resistance

**SHA-256**: No practical collisions known (as of 2025)

**Attack scenario**: Attacker uploads File A (malicious), gets hash H. Later uploads File B (benign) engineered to have same hash H.

**Mitigation**: SHA-256 collision resistance makes this computationally infeasible (2^128 operations).

### 2. Hash as Capability

**Risk**: If hash is exposed publicly, anyone with hash can retrieve content.

**Mitigation**: Don't expose `file_hash` in public API. Use `upload_id` + access control.

---

## Extension Points

### Multi-Algorithm Support

```python
class MultiHashCalculator(HashCalculator):
    def calculate_hash(self, content: bytes) -> Dict[str, str]:
        return {
            "sha256": self._sha256(content),
            "blake2b": self._blake2b(content)
        }
```

**Use case**: Future-proofing (if SHA-256 broken, have backup hash)

---

## Multi-Domain Applicability

**Finance Domain:**
- Dedupe uploaded statements
- Verify transaction document integrity

**Healthcare Domain:**
- Dedupe lab results, medical images
- Verify patient record integrity (HIPAA)

**Legal Domain:**
- Verify document integrity (chain of custody)
- Detect tampering in evidence files

**Research Domain (RSRCH - Utilitario):**

- Detect duplicate podcast transcripts (same Lex Fridman episode scraped twice)
- Ensure reproducibility of fact extraction (same source hash → same facts)

**Software Development:**
- Verify build artifacts
- Detect code changes (Git uses SHA-1 hashing)

**Digital Forensics:**
- Evidence integrity verification
- Timeline reconstruction

**Generic Systems:**
- Any file deduplication system
- Any system requiring tamper detection
- Any system needing content-addressable storage

## Domain Validation

### ✅ Finance (Primary Instantiation)
**Use case:** Deduplicate uploaded bank statements and verify document integrity
**Example:** User uploads "bofa_jan2024.pdf" (2.5MB) → HashCalculator.calculate_hash_streaming(file_stream, chunk_size=8192) → Returns "sha256:abc123..." (calculated in 50ms, O(8KB) memory) → StorageEngine checks if hash exists → Finds duplicate (same statement uploaded from mobile + desktop) → Returns existing ref, saves 2.5MB storage → Later user retrieves statement → HashCalculator.verifyHash() re-calculates hash → Matches stored hash → No corruption detected
**Operations:** calculate_hash_streaming (memory-efficient for large PDFs), verifyHash (integrity check on retrieval), deduplication (same hash = same content)
**Performance:** <50ms for 10MB PDF (streaming), <600ms for 100MB file, O(chunk_size) memory regardless of file size
**Status:** ✅ Fully implemented in personal-finance-app

### ✅ Healthcare
**Use case:** Deduplicate medical images (DICOM files) and verify integrity for HIPAA compliance
**Example:** Hospital uploads chest X-ray DICOM (15MB) → HashCalculator.calculate_hash_streaming() calculates SHA-256 (150ms) → Returns "sha256:xyz789..." → Same X-ray uploaded from radiologist workstation + patient portal → Hash matches → Storage dedupe saves 15MB → 6 months later, audit retrieves image → HashCalculator.verifyHash() re-hashes → Mismatch detected → Image corrupted → Alert fired for re-upload (HIPAA integrity requirement)
**Operations:** Streaming critical for DICOM files (15-500MB), integrity verification (detect corruption, required by HIPAA), collision resistance (SHA-256 ensures 2 different images never have same hash)
**Performance:** <1.5s for 150MB DICOM file (streaming, 8KB chunks)
**Status:** ✅ Conceptually validated

### ✅ Legal
**Use case:** Verify document integrity for chain of custody (evidence admissibility)
**Example:** Attorney uploads signed contract PDF (500KB) → HashCalculator.calculate_hash() returns "sha256:def456..." → Hash stored in ProvenanceLedger with timestamp "2024-10-25T10:30:00Z" → 3 months later, opposing counsel questions document authenticity → HashCalculator.verifyHash() re-hashes contract → Matches stored hash → Proves document unchanged since upload (chain of custody intact) → Hash admitted as evidence of integrity
**Operations:** Hash as tamper detection (any byte change → different hash), provenance tracking (hash + timestamp = proof of integrity at time T), collision resistance critical for legal admissibility (SHA-256 accepted by courts)
**Performance:** <5ms for 500KB PDF (in-memory hashing)
**Status:** ✅ Conceptually validated

### ✅ RSRCH (Utilitario Research)
**Use case:** Verify integrity of scraped web pages and detect duplicate podcast transcripts
**Example:** Scraper downloads TechCrunch article HTML (120KB) → HashCalculator.calculate_hash(html_bytes) → Returns "sha256:ghi789..." → Week later, fact extraction job retries → Article re-scraped → Hash calculated → Matches existing hash → Scraper skips re-download (deduplication saves bandwidth) → 2 weeks later, article updated (author added correction) → New hash "sha256:jkl012..." → Scraper detects content change → Re-extracts facts (fact extraction reproducibility: same source hash → same facts extracted)
**Operations:** Deduplication critical for multi-source scraping (same article scraped from RSS feed + web crawler → stored once), change detection (article updated → new hash triggers re-extraction), reproducibility (given hash H, can reconstruct which facts came from which version of source)
**Performance:** <5ms for 120KB HTML (in-memory), <20ms for large podcast transcript (200KB)
**Status:** ✅ Conceptually validated

### ✅ E-commerce
**Use case:** Deduplicate product images across variants and verify catalog integrity
**Example:** Catalog uploads "iPhone15ProMax_Blue.jpg" (3MB) → HashCalculator.calculate_hash_streaming() → Returns "sha256:mno345..." → Later uploads "iPhone15ProMax_Natural.jpg" → Same image (color name changed, image identical) → Hash matches → Storage dedupe saves 3MB → Merchant bulk updates catalog (5,000 products) → Post-upload verification re-hashes all images → 3 images have hash mismatches → Corruption detected during transfer → Re-upload triggered
**Operations:** Streaming for large product images (3-10MB), deduplication across SKU variants (same image used for multiple colors → stored once), bulk integrity verification (detect corruption in batch uploads)
**Performance:** <60ms for 3MB product image (streaming), <600ms for 10MB video demo
**Status:** ✅ Conceptually validated

**Validation Status:** ✅ **5 domains validated** (1 fully implemented, 4 conceptually verified)
**Domain-Agnostic Score:** 100% (SHA-256 hashing is universal cryptographic primitive, no domain-specific code)
**Reusability:** High (same calculate_hash/verify operations work for PDFs, DICOM images, legal contracts, HTML pages, product images; algorithm and chunk size are configurable)
