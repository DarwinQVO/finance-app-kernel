## üîÑ Transfer Reconciliation Requirements

**Critical pain point:** "No s√© en qu√© cuenta buscar" (I don't know which account to search)

**Auto-matching needed for:**

1. **BofA ‚Üí Wise ‚Üí Scotia chain**
   - Challenge: No common transaction ID between platforms
   - BofA shows: "Wise Inc DES:WISE ID:TrnWise -$2,000"
   - Wise shows: "Sent | Eugenio Castro Garza | MXN amount + USD fee"
   - Scotia shows: "TRANSF SPEI - WISE PAYMENTS LIMITED +$X MXN"
   - **Matching strategy:** Amount (¬±$1 USD) + Date (¬±2 days) + Direction

2. **Stripe ‚Üí BofA**
   - Currently: User does NOT cross-reference manually
   - Should: Link Stripe payout to BofA deposit
   - Purpose: Track fee costs, match to client invoice

**Frequency:** 10-15 inter-account transfers/month

---

## üìä Reporting Requirements

### Critical Questions User Needs Answered

**Income Analysis:**
1. "¬øCu√°nto gan√≥ mi negocio (ingresos - gastos) en Q1?"
2. "¬øA qu√© cliente le factur√© m√°s en 2024?" (auto-detect from deposits)
3. "¬øQu√© % de mis ingresos se va a fees?" (Stripe + foreign transaction)

**Expense Analysis:**
4. "¬øCu√°nto gast√© en comida este mes?" (across 3 accounts)
5. "¬øCu√°nto gasto promedio en subscriptions?" (detect all recurring)
6. "¬øCu√°nto gast√© en software deducible?" (for taxes)
7. "¬øM√©xico vs USA expenses este trimestre?"

**Cash Flow:**
8. "¬øCu√°nto dinero est√° 'en tr√°nsito' ahora?" (BofA‚ÜíWise‚ÜíScotia pending)
9. "¬øCu√°nto cash disponible REAL tengo?" (exclude pending)
10. "¬øMi burn rate aument√≥ vs promedio?" (early warning)

**Tax Prep:**
11. "Export CSV para contador" (all deductible expenses)
12. "¬øCu√°nto perd√≠ en foreign transaction fees?" (deductible)
13. "¬øA qui√©n le pagu√© m√°s como contractor?" (1099 tracking)

---

### Dashboard vs Reports

**Real-time Dashboard (Daily use):**
- Current cash available (all accounts)
- Transfers in-transit status
- Alerts (low balance, payment due, anomalies)
- MTD income, expenses, net

**Monthly Reports (Tax/Analysis):**
- Spending by category breakdown
- Income by client (auto-detected)
- Deductible vs non-deductible totals
- Export: CSV for CPA, PDF for records

**Comparisons:**
- Month vs month (detect trends)
- Year vs year (growth tracking)
- Actual vs budget (if budgets defined)

---

## üîß Client/Counterparty Auto-Detection

**Challenge:** User has 0 current clients but historical data will have ~10

**Detection strategy needed:**

**Inbound (Clients):**
```
Pattern: "WISE US INC - From [ClientName] Via WISE"
Examples:
- "From Bloom Financial Corp. Via WISE" ‚Üí Client: Bloom Financial
- "HubSpot Inc - Coupa Pay 286-31598" ‚Üí Client: HubSpot
```

**Detection rules:**
1. Recurring deposits (same source, similar amount, monthly)
2. Merchant pattern matching ("From X Via WISE" = client X)
3. Amount threshold (>$500 likely client, not refund)

**Outbound (Contractors):**
```
Pattern: Wise "Sent | [PersonName]"
Examples:
- "Sent | manuel maria mao" ‚Üí Contractor
- "Sent | Eugenio Castro Garza" ‚Üí Self (inter-account)
```

**Detection rules:**
1. Recurring Wise outbound payments
2. Amount threshold ($100-$5,000 = likely contractor)
3. Reference notes ("Doc Research", "April salary")

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Patterns Observed

### 1. Duplicate Charges (Most Common)

**Evidence from Scotia statement:**
```
19 FEB | ST UBER EATS: -$640.98
19 FEB | ST UBER EATS: -$640.98 (duplicate)
19 FEB | REV.ST UBER EATS: +$640.98 (reversed)
```

**Frequency:** 5-8 reversals per month observed

**User needs:**
- Auto-detect duplicates (same merchant, amount, date)
- Flag for review before categorizing
- Track reversal patterns (is Uber Eats buggy?)

---

### 2. Merchant Name Inconsistencies

**Examples from statements:**
| Statement Shows | Actual Merchant |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "ST UBER CARG RECUR" | Uber |
| "STRIPE UBER TRIP CIU" | Uber (via Stripe) |
| "MERPAGO*COCOBONGO" | Cocobongo (via MercadoPago) |
| "CLIP MX*HANAICHI" | Hanaichi (via Clip) |
| "OPLINEA*SONAMBULOCAFE" | Sonambulocafe |

**User needs:**
- Normalize merchant names (3.8 Cluster Rules)
- Learn from manual corrections
- Confidence scoring when ambiguous

---

### 3. Foreign Transaction Fees (Unexpected)

**Apple Card charges 3% FX fee on MXN purchases:**
```
04/26 | MERPAGO*COCOBONGO | $97.25
04/26 | FOREIGN TRANSACTION FEE | $2.91 (3%)
```

**Total fees observed:** $95.09 in one month

**User needs:**
- Auto-link fee to original transaction
- Track total FX fees (deductible business expense)
- Alert on high-fee transactions (use Scotia instead?)

---

## üéØ Feature Priority (From Pain Points)

### üî¥ **P0 - Critical (MVP)**

1. **Universal search across all accounts**
   - Pain point: "No s√© en qu√© cuenta buscar"
   - Impact: 2+ hours/month wasted searching

2. **Transfer auto-matching (BofA‚ÜíWise‚ÜíScotia)**
   - Pain point: "Dinero en limbo"
   - Impact: Cash flow uncertainty

3. **Fee tracking & net income calculation**
   - Pain point: "No s√© cu√°nto realmente gan√©"
   - Impact: $300+/month hidden costs

4. **Auto-categorization (learn from past)**
   - Pain point: "Me toma 2 horas categorizar"
   - Impact: 24 hours/year wasted

---

### üü° **P1 - Important (Post-MVP)**

5. **Recurring payment detection & alerts**
   - Alert if expected payment didn't occur
   - Alert if price changed

6. **Deductible vs non-deductible tagging**
   - For tax preparation
   - Dual jurisdiction (USA + Mexico)

7. **Client/contractor auto-detection**
   - From deposit patterns
   - For 1099 tracking

8. **Duplicate detection & reversal tracking**

---

### üü¢ **P2 - Nice-to-have (Future)**

9. **Receipt photo upload + OCR**
10. **Forecast / projections**
11. **Saved views / custom dashboards**
12. **Contador read-only access**

---

## üí° Insights for Primitive Design

### Multi-Currency is NOT Optional

- Every transaction has original currency + converted amount
- Exchange rates vary (Wise rate ‚â† bank rate)
- Need to store: `amount_original`, `currency_original`, `amount_usd`, `fx_rate`, `fx_fee`

---

### State ‚â† Category

**State:** System-driven (parsed, normalized, reconciled)
**Category:** User/rule-driven (Software, Food, Travel)

Both need to be tracked independently.

---

### Confidence Scores are Critical

Many transactions are ambiguous:
- "J. Smith" = John or Jane?
- "Uber Eats" = Personal or business meal with client?
- Transfer BofA‚ÜíWise $2,000 = which of 3 Wise transactions?

**All automated decisions need confidence_score** (0.0-1.0)

**Thresholds:**
- > 0.95: Auto-accept
- 0.70-0.95: Suggest (user confirms)
- < 0.70: Manual review required

---

### Provenance is Non-Negotiable

User does corrections frequently:
- Recategorize transaction
- Mark as business vs personal
- Link/unlink transfers

**Every correction must flow through ProvenanceLedger:**
- Who changed it
- When
- Why (reason field)
- What was old value
- What is new value

---

## üìã Checklist for Vertical Design

When designing any vertical that touches user data, verify:

- [ ] **Multi-account aware** - Can search/filter across all 6 accounts
- [ ] **Multi-currency aware** - Shows USD and MXN correctly, with conversions
- [ ] **Transfer-aware** - Doesn't double-count BofA‚ÜíWise‚ÜíScotia
- [ ] **Fee-aware** - Tracks and displays Stripe fees, FX fees, wire fees
- [ ] **Tax-aware** - Can tag deductible (USA) vs deducible (Mexico) vs personal
- [ ] **Confidence-aware** - Shows when auto-categorization is uncertain
- [ ] **Provenance-aware** - All corrections logged with reason
- [ ] **Real-time + Historical** - Dashboard (now) + Reports (monthly/YoY)

---

## üéì Domain-Specific Vocabulary

**User's mental model:**

| User Says | System Concept | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| "Cliente" | Counterparty (type: client) | Auto-detect from recurring deposits |
| "Contractor" | Counterparty (type: contractor) | Auto-detect from recurring Wise sends |
| "Transferencia" | Relationship (type: transfer) | BofA‚ÜíWise‚ÜíScotia chain |
| "Suscripci√≥n" | Series (type: subscription) | Fixed or variable recurring |
| "Deducible" | Tax categorization | Dual jurisdiction (USA + Mexico) |
| "Cuenta" | Account | BofA, Apple Card, Scotia, etc. |
| "Fee/Comisi√≥n" | Fee transaction | Linked to parent transaction |

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (How to Use This Document)

**For each vertical:**

1. **Before design:** Read relevant sections
   - Example: Vertical 2.1 (Transaction List) ‚Üí Read "Reporting Requirements", "Transaction Examples"
   - Example: Vertical 3.5 (Relationships) ‚Üí Read "Transfer Reconciliation Requirements"

2. **During design:** Validate against real patterns
   - Use transaction examples to test queries
   - Use error patterns to design edge case handling

3. **After design:** Cross-check primitives
   - Does primitive handle multi-currency? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
   - Does primitive track confidence scores? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
   - Does primitive log provenance? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
